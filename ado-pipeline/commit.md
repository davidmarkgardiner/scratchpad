Add automatic Kyverno test pipeline in ADO

This commit implements an automated test pipeline in Azure DevOps (ADO) that triggers when target files are modified. The pipeline executes tests using the Kyverno CLI, ensuring that all code merged to main has been properly validated.

- Configured ADO triggers for relevant file paths
- Integrated with existing Kyverno CLI test suite
- Verified functionality on lower engineering clusters before release

This improvement strengthens our quality assurance process by preventing untested code from reaching the main branch.
