Hi Martin, Thank you for getting back to me. As you can see I'm currently based in Edinburgh and have been successfully working remotely since COVID(2021). I have extensive experience collaborating effectively with teams while working from home and maintaining high productivity.

Regarding the 1-2 days office requirement, I would be able to travel to London when needed. I'd appreciate understanding more about the company's flexibility and policies regarding travel expenses and accommodation for these office days.

Would you be open to discussing the role further and exploring how we could make this arrangement work?"
