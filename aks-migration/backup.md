Rebuilding AKS clusters while maintaining application continuity requires careful planning around data persistence, RBAC configuration, and deployment automation. Here's a comprehensive approach:

## Pre-Migration Assessment and Backup

**Inventory Current Resources:**
- Document all running applications, services, and their dependencies
- Export current RBAC configurations: `kubectl get clusterroles,clusterrolebindings,roles,rolebindings -o yaml`
- Backup ConfigMaps and Secrets: `kubectl get configmaps,secrets --all-namespaces -o yaml`
- Document persistent volume claims and storage classes
- List all ingress controllers, load balancers, and networking configurations

**Data Backup Strategy:**
- For stateful applications, ensure data is backed up to external storage (Azure Storage, managed databases)
- Verify that persistent volumes are using Azure Disk/Files that can be detached and reattached
- Document any applications with local state that need special handling

## New Cluster Preparation

**Infrastructure as Code:**
- Use ARM templates, Bicep, or Terraform to define your new AKS cluster configuration
- Ensure the new cluster matches or improves upon current specifications (node pools, networking, add-ons)
- Plan for any Azure AD integration and managed identity configurations

**RBAC Recreation:**
- Prepare RBAC manifests based on your exported configurations
- Consider using Azure AD groups for user management rather than individual user bindings
- Document service account requirements for applications

## Migration Strategies

**Blue-Green Approach (Recommended for Production):**
1. Create the new cluster alongside the existing one
2. Deploy applications to the new cluster
3. Test thoroughly with a subset of traffic
4. Switch traffic over using DNS or load balancer changes
5. Destroy the old cluster once validated

**In-Place Replacement (Higher Risk):**
1. Schedule maintenance window
2. Backup all critical data and configurations
3. Destroy old cluster and create new one
4. Restore applications and data
5. Validate and resume operations

## Application Re-onboarding Process

**Automated Deployment Pipeline:**
- Use GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) or CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions)
- Maintain Helm charts or Kubernetes manifests in version control
- Implement automated testing and validation steps

**Staged Rollout:**
1. **Infrastructure Components First:** Install ingress controllers, monitoring, logging
2. **Stateless Applications:** Deploy applications without persistent state
3. **Stateful Applications:** Carefully migrate applications with data dependencies
4. **External Dependencies:** Update DNS, certificates, and external service configurations

**RBAC Implementation:**
- Apply cluster-level RBAC first (ClusterRoles, ClusterRoleBindings)
- Create namespaces and apply namespace-specific RBAC
- Test service account permissions for each application
- Validate user access patterns match requirements

## Validation and Testing

**Functional Testing:**
- Verify all applications are running and accessible
- Test inter-service communication
- Validate external integrations and APIs
- Confirm monitoring and logging are functioning

**Performance Validation:**
- Load test critical applications
- Monitor resource utilization
- Verify autoscaling behaviors
- Test backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Key Considerations

**Minimizing Downtime:**
- Use external databases and storage where possible
- Implement health checks and readiness probes
- Plan for DNS TTL changes if switching endpoints
- Consider using Azure Traffic Manager for gradual traffic shifting

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- Not backing up custom resource definitions (CRDs)
- Forgetting to update external systems pointing to the old cluster
- Insufficient testing of RBAC permissions
- Not accounting for certificate and secret expiration
- Overlooking network policy configurations
