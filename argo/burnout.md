**Subject: Engineering Team Resource Allocation and Support Structure**

Hi [Boss's name],

I wanted to discuss some challenges our engineering team is facing that are impacting our ability to deliver on planned features and sprint commitments.

**Current Situation:**
We're experiencing significant interruptions from SRE issues and onboarding requests that are pulling the team away from planned work. Most of our engineers don't have the specialized skills for these areas, which creates inefficiency and stress across the team.

**Proposed Solution:**
I'd like to suggest implementing a more structured support model:

1. **SRE Support Pod (2 people):** Dedicated rotation to handle infrastructure issues, with escalation to senior engineers only after documented troubleshooting steps have been completed and proven insufficient.

2. **Onboarding Support Pod (2 people):** Focus on identifying quick wins and packaging onboarding improvements into structured work that can be properly planned into our sprints.

This would allow the rest of the engineering team to maintain focus on feature delivery while ensuring these critical support areas receive proper attention.

**Why This Matters:**
Without this structure, we're essentially relying on ad-hoc firefighting, which is unsustainable. The current approach is leading to burnout and preventing us from meeting our delivery commitments.

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss this further and explore how we can implement a more sustainable workflow.
