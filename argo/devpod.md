Here's a comprehensive plan for your AKS engineering team to integrate with the other pod/team:

## Integration Plan: AKS Stack Adoption

### Phase 1: Initial Integration & POC
**Objective**: Enable the partner team to validate their application on your AKS stack

**Setup Requirements**:
- Deploy your AKS stack with non-essential components disabled to reduce complexity
- Grant cluster admin access to the partner team on dedicated POC/engineering cluster
- Ensure clear boundaries between POC environment and production systems

**Key Activities**:
- Partner team deploys and tests their application
- Identify integration points and potential issues
- Document any stack modifications needed


### Phase 2: Production-Ready Architecture
**Objective**: Transform POC learnings into repeatable, production-grade deployment patterns

**GitOps Integration**:
- Migrate configuration management to GitOps workflows
- Convert deployment scripts (if needed) to Kubernetes jobs for repeatability

**Repository Access & Management**:
- Set up appropriate repository access in GitLab/ADO
- Create service principal (SPN) with limited, specific permissions (replacing cluster admin)
- Implement least-privilege access model
- Establish code review and approval processes, this can prob live with app team

**PLatform team will**:
- Manage Azure / k8s resources declaratively through Kubernetes/ Gitops
- Maintain consistency between environments
- Enable cluster self-service resource provisioning within guardrails
- Improve audit trails and compliance

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Install and configure target clusters
2. Define resource templates and policies
3. Deploy custom resource definitions 
4. Test resource lifecycle management and rebuild process


### Success Criteria & Milestones

**Phase 1 Complete**:
- Application successfully running on AKS stack
- Integration issues documented and addressed

**Phase 2 Complete**:
- GitOps workflows operational
- Repeatable deployment processes validated
- Proper RBAC and security controls in place
