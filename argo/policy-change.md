**Subject: Development Bottleneck - Policy Change Process Impact**

Hi [Boss's name],

I wanted to bring to your attention a significant process bottleneck that's impacting our development velocity. Currently, any policy changes in our dev tenant require going through the formal change management process, which is creating substantial delays.

**The Challenge:**
Our team frequently needs to make policy adjustments across our development, pre-production, and production environments. However, the current process requires us to:
- Gather detailed evidence and engineering justification upfront
- Navigate multiple approval layers with stakeholders who may not have technical context on AKS or our codebase
- Address feedback loops that often result in rejections and re-submissions

**Business Impact:**
These policy changes are averaging approximately three weeks to complete, even for straightforward modifications. For example, the recent no data provisioner update was delayed by a month due to this process. This is creating a cascading effect on our development timelines and sprint commitments.

**Request:**
I'd like to discuss potential solutions, such as:
- Streamlined approval process for development environment changes
- Pre-approved policy templates for common scenarios
- Technical reviewer inclusion in the approval chain

Would you be available to discuss this further? I'm happy to provide specific examples and metrics if that would be helpful.

Thanks,
[Your name]
