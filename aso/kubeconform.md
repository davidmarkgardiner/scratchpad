I'll help you install Kubeconform on WSL Ubuntu. Kubeconform is a Kubernetes manifest validator that's faster than alternatives like kubeval. Here are the steps:

1. First, let's check and update your package list:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Since Kubeconform is distributed as a binary release, we'll need curl to download it:
```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
```

3. Download the latest version of Kubeconform (currently 0.6.4 as of my last update):
```bash
curl -L -o kubeconform.tar.gz https://github.com/yannh/kubeconform/releases/download/v0.6.4/kubeconform-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

4. Extract the downloaded archive:
```bash
tar xzf kubeconform.tar.gz
```

5. Move the binary to a directory in your PATH:
```bash
sudo mv kubeconform /usr/local/bin/
```

6. Make it executable:
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kubeconform
```

7. Verify the installation:
```bash
kubeconform -v
```

You can now use Kubeconform to validate your Kubernetes manifests. For example:
```bash
kubeconform deployment.yaml
```

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail or show you some common usage examples?
