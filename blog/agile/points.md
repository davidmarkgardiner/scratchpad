For story points, here's a practical approach:

**Story Point Scale and Breakdown:**
Most teams use a Fibonacci-like sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) or powers of 2 (1, 2, 4, 8). The key is that story points represent relative effort and complexity, not time.

**Typical Sizing Guidelines:**
- **1 point**: Very small, well-understood tasks (few hours)
- **2-3 points**: Small features, minor bug fixes (half to full day)
- **5 points**: Medium complexity (1-2 days)
- **8 points**: Large, complex work (3-4 days)
- **13+ points**: Too big - should be broken down

**Maximum Story Points:**
Keep individual stories under 8 points ideally. If something is 13+ points, it's usually a sign it needs to be split into smaller, more manageable pieces. This helps with estimation accuracy and allows for better progress tracking.

**For Spikes:**
Time-box spikes (research tasks) to specific durations. A one-day spike might be 3-5 points depending on your team's velocity. The key is to have a clear research goal and acceptance criteria even for spikes.

**Best Practices:**
- Use team-relative sizing (what's a 5 for your team stays a 5)
- Focus on effort, complexity, and risk - not just time
- Re-estimate if you learn something that significantly changes the scope
- Track your team's velocity over several sprints to improve future planning

The most important thing is consistency within your team rather than following any universal standard.
