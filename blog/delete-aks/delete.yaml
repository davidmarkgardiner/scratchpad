# Delete AKS Development Clusters to Reduce Costs

## Summary
Implement a strategy to delete AKS development clusters during non-use periods to reduce cloud infrastructure costs. Since these clusters use Node Auto-Provisioning (NAP), they cannot be simply started/stopped and must be deleted and recreated as needed.

## Business Value
- **Significant cost savings** for the company by eliminating idle AKS cluster compute costs
- Promotes efficient resource utilization and cloud cost optimization
- Aligns with FinOps best practices for non-production environments

## Background
- Development AKS clusters are running 24/7, incurring costs even when not actively used
- Clusters utilize NAP (Node Auto-Provisioning), preventing traditional start/stop operations
- Deletion and recreation is the only viable approach for cost optimization

## Requirements

### Stakeholder Alignment
- [ ] Obtain agreement from Business stakeholders on cluster deletion strategy
- [ ] Align with Process team on deletion/deployment procedures
- [ ] Communicate impact and benefits to all affected development teams

### Automation & Tooling
- [ ] Develop GitOps patterns for cluster recreation and workload deployment
- [ ] Create workflow automation for:
  - Cluster deletion (scheduled or on-demand)
  - Cluster recreation with consistent configuration
  - Automatic workload redeployment
- [ ] Provide self-service mechanisms for developers to trigger cluster recreation

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Establish comprehensive testing procedures for deletion/recreation process
- [ ] Validate workload recovery and data persistence strategies
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with ongoing 1.6.1 release work
- [ ] Document recovery time objectives (RTO) for cluster recreation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot (Select Dev Clusters)
- Identify 2-3 non-critical development clusters for initial rollout
- Implement automation patterns
- Gather metrics on cost savings and operational impact
- Refine processes based on pilot feedback

### Phase 2: All Development Clusters
- Roll out to all development environment clusters
- Monitor adoption and address any issues
- Document lessons learned

### Phase 3: Pre-Production Environments
- Extend strategy to pre-production clusters
- Implement more sophisticated scheduling based on usage patterns
- Ensure robust testing procedures are in place

### Phase 4: Production (Out of Scope)
- Production clusters will remain always-on
- No changes to production infrastructure

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Minimum 40% cost reduction in development AKS infrastructure spend
- [ ] Cluster recreation time < 15 minutes
- [ ] Zero data loss during deletion/recreation cycles
- [ ] 95% developer satisfaction with new workflow

## Communication Plan
- [ ] Create documentation for new deployment patterns
- [ ] Conduct training sessions for development teams
- [ ] Establish clear communication channels for scheduled deletions
- [ ] Provide mindset adjustment guidance for teams

## Technical Considerations
- **State Management**: Ensure persistent volumes and configurations are backed up
- **Secrets Management**: Automate secret recreation or use external secret stores
- **Network Configuration**: Maintain consistent networking setup across recreations
- **CI/CD Integration**: Update pipelines to handle dynamic cluster availability

## Dependencies
- GitOps tooling (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux)
- Infrastructure as Code templates (Terraform/Bicep)
- Current 1.6.1 release work completion
- Business and Process team approvals

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Developer workflow disruption | High | Provide comprehensive automation and self-service tools |
| Data loss during deletion | High | Implement robust backup strategies for persistent data |
| Increased complexity | Medium | Clear documentation and training |
| Resistance to change | Medium | Demonstrate cost savings and provide adjustment period |

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Business and Process teams have signed off on the approach
- [ ] Automation patterns are implemented and tested
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accessible
- [ ] Pilot phase shows measurable cost savings
- [ ] Recovery procedures are validated and meet RTO requirements

## Priority
**High** - Significant cost savings opportunity

## Estimated Effort
- Planning & Alignment: 1 week
- Automation Development: 2-3 weeks
- Pilot Phase: 2 weeks
- Full Rollout: 4-6 weeks

## Team Members
- Infrastructure Team Lead
- DevOps Engineers
- Business Stakeholder Representative
- Process Team Representative
- Development Team Leads (for feedback)
