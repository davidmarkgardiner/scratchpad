**Subject:** Critical Resource Allocation and Leadership Issues - UK8s/Shared AKS Project

## Executive Summary

I am writing to escalate critical operational and leadership challenges within the UK8s/Shared AKS platform team that are impacting service delivery and team sustainability.

## Current Situation

The platform team is experiencing severe capacity constraints and leadership gaps that are affecting our ability to meet organizational demands. Key issues include:

### Workload Distribution
- **Ticket Backlog:** 70-80 outstanding tickets requiring platform team intervention
- **Uneven Responsibility:** Critical tasks consistently fall to 2-3 team members while others remain disengaged
- **Cross-functional Pressure:** Increasing demands from SRE for incident support and application onboarding across the bank

### Leadership and Accountability
- **Decision-making Inefficiency:** Daily meetings rehashing the same issues without clear ownership or resolution
- **Lack of Accountability:** When volunteers are requested, there is minimal response and no follow-through mechanisms
- **Limited Technical Direction:** Insufficient technical leadership guidance for complex platform decisions

### Resource Concerns
- **Knowledge Concentration:** The entire platform has been primarily built and maintained by 2-3 individuals, creating significant risk
- **Team Engagement:** Several team members are not actively contributing to shared responsibilities
- **Sustainability Risk:** Current workload distribution is unsustainable and affecting team member wellbeing

## Business Impact

- **Service Delivery Risk:** Critical platform services dependent on too few individuals
- **Scalability Constraints:** Unable to effectively respond to increasing organizational demand
- **Knowledge Risk:** Potential service disruption if key team members become unavailable
- **Team Retention:** Risk of losing critical platform expertise due to burnout


I would welcome the opportunity to discuss these concerns in detail and collaborate on solutions that ensure sustainable platform operations while supporting team member wellbeing.
