To install the GitLab CLI on WSL, you have a few options. Here's the most straightforward approach:

## Option 1: Download the binary directly (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release:**
   ```bash
   curl -L "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/glab_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz" | tar -xz
   ```

2. **Move it to your PATH:**
   ```bash
   sudo mv bin/glab /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   glab version
   ```

## Option 2: Using package managers

**For Ubuntu/Debian-based WSL distributions:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/0F56C88847C34A9B3E8E7C16C9EDB05F6D1D4F3C | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/glab-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/glab-archive-keyring.gpg] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/packages/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/glab.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install glab
```

**If you have Homebrew on WSL:**
```bash
brew install glab
```

## Option 3: Using Go (if you have Go installed)

```bash
go install gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/cmd/glab@latest
```

## Initial Setup

After installation, authenticate with GitLab:

```bash
glab auth login
```

This will prompt you to choose your GitLab instance and authentication method (browser or token).

The binary download method (Option 1) is usually the quickest and most reliable for WSL environments.

Let me search for the current correct download URL for the GitLab CLI to make sure I'm giving you accurate information.Let me get the specific installation documentation from the GitLab CLI repository to verify the correct download URL.Let me search for the actual releases page to see the current download URLs.Let me fetch the actual releases page to see the current download URLs:Let me search for a working example or more recent documentation:Based on my research, I need to clarify something important about the URL you asked about:

**The URL you provided appears to be outdated or incorrect.** The correct approach is slightly different.

Here's what I found from the official documentation:

## Correct Installation Methods:

**Option 1: Direct binary download (Recommended)**
```bash
# Download from the releases page - you'll need to check the current version
curl -L "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/v1.XX.X/downloads/glab_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz" | tar -xz
sudo mv bin/glab /usr/local/bin/
```

However, since the exact URL structure may change with versions, **the most reliable method** is:

**Option 2: Using package managers (Most reliable)**

For Ubuntu/Debian WSL:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.gitlab.com/packages.gitlab.com/install/deb/cli.gitlab.com.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/gitlab-cli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/gitlab-cli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-cli/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab-cli.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install glab
```

**Option 3: Using Snap (Simplest)**
```bash
sudo snap install glab
```

**Option 4: Using Homebrew (if available)**
```bash
brew install glab
```

The URL format you mentioned (`permalink/latest/downloads/`) doesn't appear to be the current standard for GitLab CLI releases. I recommend using one of the package manager methods above for the most reliable installation on WSL.
