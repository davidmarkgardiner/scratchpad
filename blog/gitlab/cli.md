To install the GitLab CLI on WSL, you have a few options. Here's the most straightforward approach:

## Option 1: Download the binary directly (Recommended)

1. **Download the latest release:**
   ```bash
   curl -L "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/permalink/latest/downloads/glab_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz" | tar -xz
   ```

2. **Move it to your PATH:**
   ```bash
   sudo mv bin/glab /usr/local/bin/
   ```

3. **Verify the installation:**
   ```bash
   glab version
   ```

## Option 2: Using package managers

**For Ubuntu/Debian-based WSL distributions:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/0F56C88847C34A9B3E8E7C16C9EDB05F6D1D4F3C | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/glab-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/glab-archive-keyring.gpg] https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/packages/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/glab.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install glab
```

**If you have Homebrew on WSL:**
```bash
brew install glab
```

## Option 3: Using Go (if you have Go installed)

```bash
go install gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/cmd/glab@latest
```

## Initial Setup

After installation, authenticate with GitLab:

```bash
glab auth login
```

This will prompt you to choose your GitLab instance and authentication method (browser or token).

The binary download method (Option 1) is usually the quickest and most reliable for WSL environments.
