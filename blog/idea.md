Subject: Proposal for Team Performance Improvement Initiative

Dear [Boss's Name],

I wanted to discuss the current challenges we're facing with [Team/Project Name] and propose a structured approach to address them.

**Current Situation:**
The team is not meeting performance expectations, which is putting our project deliverables at risk. This initiative is critical to the bank's operations and has significant cost-saving potential, but we need the right people in place to achieve success.

**Proposed Solution:**
I'd like to suggest implementing a performance-based retention program with the following structure:

• **Incentive Component:** 20% pay increase for team members who commit to the restructured program
• **Performance Timeline:** 
  - Year 1: 50% team optimization
  - Year 2: 40% further optimization  
  - Year 3: 30% continued refinement
  - Year 4: 20% final adjustments

• **Transition Support:** Team members who don't meet performance standards would have the opportunity to transfer to other departments where their skills might be better utilized

**Business Case:**
This project is integral to our forward operations strategy. Without addressing the current performance gaps, we risk project failure and miss substantial cost-saving opportunities. A proactive approach now will ensure we have the right talent aligned with our objectives.

I believe this structured approach will help us build a high-performing team while providing clear expectations and support for all involved. I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss this proposal and explore next steps.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
