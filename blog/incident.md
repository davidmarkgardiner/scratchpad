I'll help you put together a professional incident report. Let me structure this with the information you've provided:

## Incident Report: Kyverno Job Multiplication Issue

### Executive Summary
An issue was identified where Kyverno jobs were spawning excessively due to pod deployment failures related to certificate issues. This resulted in multiple redundant jobs being created instead of the expected single job per pod deployment.

### Incident Details

**Issue Identified:** Excessive Kyverno job creation during pod deployments
**Root Cause:** Certificate failure causing pods to crash and retry, triggering new job creation with each retry attempt
**Expected Behavior:** One job should run per pod when deployments are successful
**Actual Behavior:** Multiple jobs spawned for each pod due to crash-retry cycles

### Impact Assessment
- Resource consumption increased due to redundant job executions
- Potential performance degradation on affected clusters
- Currently affecting preprod and prod environments

### Proposed Mitigation Strategy

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Implement job naming convention using image hash/SHA to ensure idempotency
   - This will prevent duplicate jobs from being created for the same image
   - Each unique image will only trigger one job execution

**Next Steps:**
1. **Environment Assessment**
   - Investigate job behavior across all clusters to understand scope
   - Compare behavior patterns between dev, preprod, and prod environments

2. **Observability Implementation**
   - Set up comprehensive monitoring for Kyverno job creation and execution
   - Implement alerting thresholds for abnormal job spawning patterns
   - Create dashboards to track job-to-pod ratios

3. **Pre-enablement Requirements for Dev Environment**
   - Deploy monitoring and observability tools
   - Establish baseline metrics for normal operation
   - Define alert thresholds and escalation procedures

### Lessons Learned
- Earlier detection mechanisms should have identified this issue sooner
- Need better visibility into job behavior across all clusters
- Importance of having observability in place before enabling in development environments

### Action Items
- [ ] Update job naming to use image hash/SHA
- [ ] Audit job behavior on all clusters
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting solution
- [ ] Document normal vs. abnormal job patterns
- [ ] Re-enable in dev only after observability is operational
