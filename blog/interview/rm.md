Here are behavioral interview questions tailored for your platform engineering role:

## Technical Problem-Solving & Troubleshooting

**"Tell me about a time when you had to debug a particularly challenging issue in a Kubernetes environment. Walk me through your troubleshooting process."**
- Looking for: Systematic approach, use of kubectl/monitoring tools, understanding of K8s architecture, persistence

**"Describe a situation where you had to diagnose and resolve a production incident with limited information or observability. How did you approach it?"**
- Looking for: Methodical thinking, ability to work under pressure, creative problem-solving, communication during incidents

**"Give me an example of when you identified and fixed a performance bottleneck in a CI/CD pipeline. What metrics did you use to measure improvement?"**
- Looking for: Pipeline optimization experience, data-driven decisions, understanding of build/deploy efficiency

## Self-Direction & Independence

**"Tell me about a project or initiative you identified and drove to completion without being asked. What was the impact?"**
- Looking for: Proactive identification of problems/opportunities, ability to build consensus, follow-through

**"Describe a time when you had to learn a new technology or tool quickly with minimal guidance to solve a problem. How did you approach the learning curve?"**
- Looking for: Self-learning ability, resourcefulness, comfort with ambiguity

**"Share an example of when you had to make a significant technical decision without having your manager or senior team members available. What was your thought process?"**
- Looking for: Decision-making framework, risk assessment, documentation of decisions, confidence balanced with prudence

## Cross-functional & Process Improvement

**"Tell me about a time when you improved an application onboarding or release process. What was broken, and how did you fix it?"**
- Looking for: Process thinking, stakeholder management, automation mindset, measuring success

**"Describe a situation where you had to work with a development team that was resistant to following platform standards or best practices. How did you handle it?"**
- Looking for: Influence without authority, empathy, communication skills, finding win-win solutions

**"Give an example of when you had to balance competing priorities between maintaining platform stability and delivering new features. How did you manage the trade-offs?"**
- Looking for: Prioritization skills, understanding of technical debt, stakeholder communication

## Code & Automation

**"Tell me about a complex automation or tooling project you've built in Go or Python. What problem did it solve, and why did you choose that particular approach?"**
- Looking for: Coding proficiency, design thinking, understanding of maintainability

**"Describe a time when you inherited poorly documented or legacy code/infrastructure. How did you approach understanding and improving it?"**
- Looking for: Code archaeology skills, patience, incremental improvement approach, documentation mindset

## SRE Mindset

**"Tell me about a time when you had to design or implement observability for a system. What metrics and alerts did you prioritize and why?"**
- Looking for: SRE principles understanding, SLI/SLO thinking, noise reduction strategies

**"Share an experience where you had to perform a post-mortem for a significant incident. How did you ensure it led to meaningful improvements?"**
- Looking for: Blameless culture, root cause analysis, follow-through on action items

These questions should help you assess whether candidates have the independent problem-solving skills, technical depth, and platform engineering mindset you're looking for. Consider following up with probing questions about specific technical details, team dynamics, or outcomes to get deeper insights.
