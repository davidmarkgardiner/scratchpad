Great question! VPA in "Initial" mode still needs historical data to make informed decisions. Here's how it actually works:

## How VPA "Initial" Mode Determines Resources

### The Process

1. **VPA continuously collects metrics** even in "Initial" mode
2. **It builds a recommendation model** based on observed usage
3. **When a NEW pod is created**, it applies the current recommendation
4. **After that initial setting**, it never touches that pod again

Here's what happens under the hood:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: example-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: Deployment
    name: my-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Initial"  # Only acts on pod creation
```

## The Chicken-and-Egg Problem

You're right to spot the issue - **how can it recommend resources for a pod that hasn't run yet?**

### Scenario 1: Existing Workload
If the deployment already has running pods:
```
Day 1: Deploy pods with manual requests (CPU: 1000m, Memory: 2Gi)
Day 2-7: VPA observes actual usage (CPU: 200m, Memory: 512Mi)
Day 8: You trigger a rollout â†’ New pods get VPA's recommendation (CPU: 250m, Memory: 640Mi)
```

### Scenario 2: Brand New Workload
For completely new deployments, VPA in Initial mode will:
1. **Use the original manifest's resources** for the first pods
2. **Start learning immediately** from those pods
3. **Only apply recommendations when pods are recreated** (next deployment, scaling event, node failure)

## The Timeline Example

```bash
# Hour 0: Deploy new app with VPA in Initial mode
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml  # Has requests: cpu=1000m
kubectl apply -f vpa.yaml         # VPA in Initial mode

# Hour 0-24: First pods run with original 1000m CPU
# VPA observes: "This pod only uses 100-200m CPU"

# Hour 48: VPA has built recommendation: cpu=250m

# Hour 72: You update the deployment (new image)
kubectl set image deployment/my-app app=myapp:v2

# NEW pods now start with VPA recommendation: cpu=250m
# OLD pods had cpu=1000m (VPA never touched them)
```

## Key Limitations of Initial Mode

### 1. **No Immediate Effect on First Deploy**
```yaml
# This won't help on first deploy:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: brand-new-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 2000m  # These oversized requests will be used initially
            memory: 4Gi  # VPA can't help until next rollout
```

### 2. **Requires Pod Recreation for Updates**
VPA Initial mode only applies recommendations when pods are created due to:
- Deployments/rollouts
- Scaling events (if scaling from 0)
- Pod evictions/node failures
- Manual pod deletion

## Strategies to Make Initial Mode More Effective

### 1. **Bootstrap with Historical Data**
If you have similar workloads, you can copy VPA recommendations:

```bash
# Get recommendations from similar app
kubectl get vpa similar-app-vpa -o jsonpath='{.status.recommendation}' > recommendations.json

# Create new VPA with checkpoint (advanced technique)
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: new-app-vpa
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: "apps/v1"
    kind: Deployment
    name: new-app
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Initial"
  # You can't directly set recommendations, but you can use similar 
  # workload patterns for faster learning
EOF
```

### 2. **Force Learning Period**
Deploy in stages to let VPA learn:

```bash
# Stage 1: Deploy with conservative requests + VPA in Off mode
kubectl apply -f deployment-conservative.yaml
kubectl apply -f vpa-off-mode.yaml

# Wait 24-48 hours for VPA to learn

# Stage 2: Switch VPA to Initial mode
kubectl patch vpa my-vpa --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/updatePolicy/updateMode", "value":"Initial"}]'

# Stage 3: Trigger rollout to apply recommendations
kubectl rollout restart deployment/my-app
```

### 3. **Use Resource Classes**
Create templates based on workload patterns:

```yaml
# Small workload VPA template
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: small-workload-vpa
spec:
  resourcePolicy:
    containerPolicies:
    - containerName: '*'
      minAllowed:
        cpu: 50m
        memory: 64Mi
      maxAllowed:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 512Mi
      controlledResources: ["cpu", "memory"]
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Initial"
```

## Practical Recommendation

For your AKS cluster with Karpenter, here's the optimal approach:

```yaml
# Step 1: Deploy VPA in "Off" mode initially
apiVersion: autoscaling.k8s.io/v1
kind: VerticalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: learning-vpa
spec:
  updatePolicy:
    updateMode: "Off"  # Just learning, no actions

# Step 2: After 3-7 days, check recommendations
kubectl get vpa learning-vpa -o jsonpath='{.status.recommendation}'

# Step 3: If recommendations look good, switch to Initial
kubectl patch vpa learning-vpa --type='merge' \
  -p '{"spec":{"updatePolicy":{"updateMode":"Initial"}}}'

# Step 4: New pods (from scaling/deployments) get optimized resources
# Existing pods remain untouched (no evictions!)
```

This way:
- **No surprises** on initial deployment
- **VPA learns from actual behavior** before making changes
- **No conflict with Karpenter** (no unexpected evictions)
- **Gradual optimization** as pods naturally recreate

The key insight: **Initial mode isn't magic** - it still needs to observe your workload first. It just promises to only apply its recommendations to new pods, never evicting existing ones.
