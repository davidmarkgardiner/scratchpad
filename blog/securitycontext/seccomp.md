Seccomp is a Linux kernel feature that restricts which system calls (low-level operations like opening files or creating network connections) a process is allowed to make, reducing the attack surface if the process gets compromised.

GitLab Runner executes user-defined CI/CD pipelines that often need to do privileged things like build Docker images, install packages, or run tests that require system-level operations—all of which need system calls that default seccomp profiles block.

---

Looking at your security context, you have a **very restrictive** configuration. Let me explain what will and won't work with these settings for GitLab Runner.

## What These Settings Mean

```yaml
allowPrivilegeEscalation: false  # Can't gain more privileges than parent process
readOnlyRootFilesystem: false    # CAN write to root filesystem (only permissive setting here)
runAsNonRoot: true                # Must run as non-root user (UID != 0)
privileged: false                 # No privileged mode (can't access host devices, limited capabilities)
capabilities:
  drop: ["ALL"]                   # Drops ALL Linux capabilities
```

## What Will Work ✅

**Basic GitLab Runner operations:**
- Cloning repositories via HTTPS
- Running simple shell scripts
- Executing tests (unit tests, linting, etc.)
- Building static sites
- Running interpreted languages (Python, Ruby, Node.js scripts)
- Writing to `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, and mounted volumes
- Network operations (HTTP requests, API calls)

**Example working pipeline:**
```yaml
test:
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm test
    - python -m pytest
    - bundle exec rspec
```

## What Will NOT Work ❌

**1. Docker-in-Docker / Building containers**
```yaml
# This will FAIL
script:
  - docker build -t myapp .
  - docker push myapp
```
Reason: Needs `privileged: true` and various capabilities

**2. Installing system packages**
```yaml
# This will FAIL
script:
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get install -y some-package
  - yum install package
```
Reason: Needs root user or CAP_CHOWN, CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, CAP_FOWNER

**3. Binding to privileged ports (<1024)**
```yaml
# This will FAIL
script:
  - python -m http.server 80
  - npm start  # if it tries to bind to port 443
```
Reason: Needs CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

**4. Modifying system files or configurations**
```yaml
# This will FAIL
script:
  - echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" > /etc/resolv.conf
  - sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```
Reason: Needs root and various capabilities

**5. Changing file ownership**
```yaml
# This will FAIL
script:
  - chown nobody:nobody file.txt
  - chmod 4755 binary  # setuid bit
```
Reason: Needs CAP_CHOWN, CAP_FOWNER

## Modifications to Make It More Functional

Depending on your needs, here are some options:

### Option 1: Allow Some Capabilities (Moderate Security)
```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  runAsNonRoot: true
  privileged: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE  # Bind to ports <1024
      - CHOWN            # Change file ownership (for package managers)
      - DAC_OVERRIDE     # Bypass file permission checks
      - FOWNER           # Bypass permission checks on files
      - SETGID           # Needed by some installers
      - SETUID           # Needed by some installers
```

### Option 2: Allow Root for Package Installation (Lower Security)
```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  runAsNonRoot: false  # Changed to allow root
  privileged: false
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add:
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
```

### Option 3: For Docker Builds (Much Lower Security)
```yaml
securityContext:
  privileged: true  # Required for Docker-in-Docker
  # Other settings become less relevant when privileged=true
```

## Recommended Approach

For **GitLab Runner specifically**, I'd suggest:

```yaml
securityContext:
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: false
  runAsNonRoot: false  # Allow root for flexibility
  privileged: false    # Keep this false unless you absolutely need Docker-in-Docker
  capabilities:
    drop: ["ALL"]
    add:
      - CHOWN
      - DAC_OVERRIDE
      - FOWNER
      - SETGID
      - SETUID
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
```

This allows:
- Package installation (apt, yum, etc.)
- File permission management
- Running services on standard ports
- Most CI/CD tasks

But still blocks:
- Direct hardware access
- Kernel module loading
- Host namespace access
- Most privilege escalation paths

## Alternative: Use Pre-built Images

If security is critical, use Docker images with **everything pre-installed**:

```yaml
test:
  image: node:18-alpine  # Already has Node.js
  script:
    - npm ci  # Uses package-lock.json, doesn't need root
    - npm test
```

This way you can keep your very restrictive security context and still get work done!
