I'll help you install Visual Studio Code on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). There are two main approaches:

## Option 1: Install VS Code on Windows (Recommended)

This is the most common and recommended approach. You install VS Code on Windows and use the WSL extension to work with files in your WSL environment.

**Steps:**

1. **Install VS Code on Windows** (if not already installed):
   - Download from https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Run the installer

2. **Install the WSL extension**:
   - Open VS Code on Windows
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+X` to open Extensions
   - Search for "WSL" 
   - Install the "WSL" extension by Microsoft

3. **Open your WSL project in VS Code**:
   - Open your WSL terminal (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.)
   - Navigate to your project directory
   - Run: `code .`
   - This will open VS Code on Windows connected to your WSL filesystem

The first time you run `code .` from WSL, it will install the VS Code Server in WSL automatically.

## Option 2: Install VS Code directly in WSL (GUI)

If you're running WSL 2 with WSLg (GUI support), you can install VS Code directly in Linux:

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install dependencies
sudo apt install wget gpg

# Add Microsoft's GPG key
wget -qO- https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | gpg --dearmor > packages.microsoft.gpg
sudo install -D -o root -g root -m 644 packages.microsoft.gpg /etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg

# Add VS Code repository
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64,arm64,armhf signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/packages.microsoft.gpg] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/code stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/vscode.list'

# Install VS Code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install code
```

Then launch with: `code`

**I recommend Option 1** as it provides better integration, performance, and is the officially recommended approach by Microsoft. Which option would you like to proceed with?
