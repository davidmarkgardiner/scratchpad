I'll help draft an email that advocates for using ASO/crossplane with a developer platform frontend for cluster provisioning.

Subject: Proposal: Streamlining AKS Deployment Strategy with ASO/Crossplane and Developer Platform

Hi team,

I wanted to share some thoughts on our AKS deployment strategy moving forward. After evaluating our current approach and future needs, I believe we should pivot towards a Kubernetes-native infrastructure provisioning model using either Azure Service Operator (ASO) or Crossplane, integrated with an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) like Backstage.

Key benefits of this approach:

1. Simplified Developer Experience
   - One-click cluster provisioning through a self-service portal
   - Consistent interface for both infrastructure and application deployment
   - Reduced cognitive load for SRE teams

2. Technical Advantages
   - ASO already supports ~90% of our cluster stack requirements
   - Uses the same underlying Azure API calls as ARM
   - Built-in state management and drift detection
   - Native GitOps workflow support

3. Technical Debt Reduction
   - Eliminates the current complexity of mixing ARM, Ansible, and Terraform
   - Single source of truth for infrastructure configuration
   - Reduces tool sprawl and maintenance overhead
   - Consistent deployment patterns across teams

4. Immediate Implementation Potential
   - ASO is production-ready and Azure-supported
   - No need to wait for feature maturity since it leverages existing Azure APIs
   - Can begin migration with pilot clusters while maintaining existing infrastructure

Next Steps:
1. Set up a proof of concept using ASO/Crossplane
2. Evaluate Backstage integration for the developer portal
3. Document migration strategy for existing clusters
4. Define success metrics and rollback procedures

The main gap this solves is providing our SRE teams with a streamlined, one-click deployment approach while eliminating the technical debt created by our current multi-tool strategy.

Would you be available to discuss this proposal in more detail? I'd like to get your thoughts on the implementation timeline and any concerns you might have.

Best regards,
[Your name]

P.S. I can prepare a more detailed technical comparison if helpful for the discussion.


Title: Monitoring Reader Role Assignment for Deployer Service Principal
Requirement:
The deployer service principal needs Monitoring Reader access to all Azure Monitor workspaces, both existing and future ones.
Why it's important:

Critical for testing functionality
Tests will fail without proper role binding
Prevents testing interruptions

Proposed Solution:
Instead of manually binding roles for each new cluster, assign the Monitoring Reader role at the UK8s management group level. This will:

Automatically apply to all current clusters
Apply to any future clusters
Eliminate ongoing operational overhead
