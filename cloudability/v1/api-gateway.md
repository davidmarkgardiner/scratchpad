For Kubernetes-native cross-cluster application mobility with zero-downtime autorouting, you'll want to look at these solutions:

## **Multi-Cluster Service Mesh**

**Istio Multi-Cluster**
- Cross-cluster service discovery and routing
- Automatic failover between clusters
- Traffic splitting for gradual migrations
- Works with multiple AKS clusters connected via VNet peering or VPN

**Linkerd Multi-Cluster**
- Simpler than Istio but effective for cross-cluster communication
- Service mirroring for traffic replication
- Built-in observability

## **Dedicated Multi-Cluster Solutions**

**Admiral (Istio-based)**
- Designed specifically for multi-cluster deployments
- Automatic service discovery across clusters
- Traffic routing based on locality and health

**Submariner**
- CNCF project for connecting Kubernetes clusters
- Cross-cluster service discovery via Lighthouse
- Network connectivity via Gateway Engine
- Works with any CNI (including your AKS CNI overlay)

**Cilium Cluster Mesh**
- High-performance cross-cluster networking
- Native multi-cluster service discovery
- Requires Cilium CNI (would need to replace Azure CNI)

## **Application-Level Solutions**

**Flagger + Istio/Linkerd**
- Progressive delivery with automatic rollbacks
- Cross-cluster canary deployments
- Traffic shifting based on success metrics

**Argo Rollouts**
- Advanced deployment strategies
- Can coordinate with service mesh for traffic management
- Blue/green and canary across clusters

## **Recommended Architecture**

For AKS with CNI overlay, I'd suggest:

1. **Istio Multi-Cluster** as the foundation
   - Deploy Istio on each AKS cluster
   - Configure cross-cluster service discovery
   - Use VNet peering between clusters for connectivity

2. **External DNS + Traffic Manager/Front Door**
   - Automatic DNS updates as services move
   - Global load balancing with health checks

3. **Flagger or Argo Rollouts**
   - Orchestrate the actual application migrations
   - Automated traffic shifting and rollback

This gives you:
- Zero-downtime migrations via traffic splitting
- Automatic service discovery across clusters
- Health-based routing
- Rollback capabilities

Would you like me to detail the setup for any of these approaches, or do you have specific requirements around deployment patterns or network constraints?

Several API gateway solutions work well with AKS clusters, each with different strengths:

## **Azure-Native Options**

**Azure Application Gateway + AGIC**
- Azure Application Gateway Ingress Controller integrates directly with AKS
- Layer 7 load balancing, SSL termination, WAF capabilities
- Good for Azure-centric environments

**Azure API Management (APIM)**
- Full-featured API management platform
- Can front AKS services with policies, authentication, rate limiting
- Hybrid deployment options (external, internal, or self-hosted gateway in AKS)

## **Kubernetes-Native Ingress Controllers**

**NGINX Ingress Controller**
- Most popular choice, mature and well-documented
- Excellent performance and flexibility
- Strong community support

**Traefik**
- Cloud-native with automatic service discovery
- Built-in Let's Encrypt integration
- Good UI and metrics

**Istio Gateway**
- Part of Istio service mesh
- Advanced traffic management and security features
- Higher complexity but powerful for microservices

**Ambassador/Emissary-Ingress**
- Built on Envoy proxy
- Good developer experience with CRDs
- GitOps-friendly configuration

## **Dedicated API Gateway Solutions**

**Kong Gateway**
- Enterprise-grade with extensive plugin ecosystem
- Can run as ingress controller or standalone
- Strong rate limiting and authentication features

**Gloo Gateway (Solo.io)**
- Function-level routing capabilities
- GraphQL and gRPC support
- Built on Envoy

**AWS API Gateway** (if using multi-cloud)
- Can front AKS services via private connectivity
- Serverless scaling model

## **Recommendations by Use Case**

- **Simple web apps**: NGINX Ingress Controller
- **Azure-heavy environment**: Application Gateway + AGIC or APIM
- **Microservices with service mesh**: Istio Gateway
- **Enterprise API management**: Kong or Azure APIM
- **Developer-friendly**: Traefik or Ambassador

What's your specific use case? Are you looking for basic ingress, full API management, or something in between?
