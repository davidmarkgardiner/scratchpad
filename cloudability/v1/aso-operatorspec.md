Yes, you can use `operatorSpec` with AKS clusters to automatically create ConfigMaps containing the OIDC issuer URL, similar to how it works with UserAssignedIdentity.

For ManagedCluster (AKS), you can configure the `operatorSpec.configMaps` to extract the OIDC issuer URL. Here's how:

```yaml
apiVersion: containerservice.azure.com/v1api20231001
kind: ManagedCluster
metadata:
  name: my-aks-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  location: eastus
  owner:
    name: my-resource-group
  # ... other cluster configuration
  operatorSpec:
    configMaps:
      oidcIssuerProfile.issuerURL:
        name: aks-oidc-config
        key: issuer-url
      # You can also extract other useful values
      fqdn:
        name: aks-oidc-config  
        key: cluster-fqdn
      # If you need the cluster name for workload identity setup
      name:
        name: aks-oidc-config
        key: cluster-name
```

This will create a ConfigMap named `aks-oidc-config` with the OIDC issuer URL:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: aks-oidc-config
  namespace: default
data:
  issuer-url: "https://eastus.oic.prod-aks.azure.com/tenant-id/cluster-uuid/"
  cluster-fqdn: "my-aks-cluster-dns-12345678.hcp.eastus.azmk8s.io"
  cluster-name: "my-aks-cluster"
```

**Key points:**
- The field path `oidcIssuerProfile.issuerURL` corresponds to the OIDC issuer URL in the AKS cluster status
- Make sure your cluster has the OIDC issuer enabled (it's enabled by default in newer AKS versions)
- The ConfigMap will be created/updated automatically by ASO when the cluster is ready

This approach is much cleaner than manually extracting the OIDC URL and creating ConfigMaps yourself!
