When upgrading Azure Service Operator (ASO) images, you need to update the CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) separately since they're not automatically updated with the operator image. Here's how to handle this:

## Methods to Update ASO CRDs

**1. Using Helm (Recommended)**
If you installed ASO via Helm, update both CRDs and the operator:

```bash
# Update the Helm repo
helm repo update

# Upgrade ASO (this will update CRDs and the operator)
helm upgrade azure-service-operator azure-service-operator \
  --repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/main/v2/charts \
  --namespace azureserviceoperator-system \
  --create-namespace
```

**2. Manual CRD Update**
If you need to update CRDs manually:

```bash
# Download the latest CRDs for your ASO version
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/releases/download/v2.x.x/azureserviceoperator_v2.x.x_crd.yaml

# Then update your ASO deployment/image
kubectl set image deployment/azureserviceoperator-controller-manager \
  manager=mcr.microsoft.com/k8s/azureserviceoperator:v2.x.x \
  -n azureserviceoperator-system
```

**3. Using kubectl replace (if apply fails)**
Sometimes you need to replace CRDs if there are schema conflicts:

```bash
kubectl replace -f https://github.com/Azure/azure-service-operator/releases/download/v2.x.x/azureserviceoperator_v2.x.x_crd.yaml
```

## Important Considerations

**Check for Breaking Changes**
- Review the ASO release notes for any breaking changes
- Some CRD updates might require resource recreation

**Backup First**
```bash
# Backup existing ASO resources
kubectl get crd -o yaml | grep azure.com > aso-crds-backup.yaml
```

**Version Compatibility**
- Ensure the CRD version matches your target ASO operator version
- Check the compatibility matrix in ASO documentation

**Rolling Update Strategy**
1. Update CRDs first
2. Update the operator image
3. Verify all resources are still functioning

Which version of ASO are you upgrading from/to? That would help me provide more specific guidance for any version-specific considerations.
