To uninstall the Flux extension from your AKS cluster using the Azure CLI, use the following command:

```bash
az k8s-extension delete \
  --name flux \
  --cluster-name <your-cluster-name> \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --cluster-type managedClusters
```

Replace `<your-cluster-name>` and `<your-resource-group>` with your actual cluster name and resource group.

If you want to confirm the deletion without prompting, add the `--yes` flag:

```bash
az k8s-extension delete \
  --name flux \
  --cluster-name <your-cluster-name> \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --cluster-type managedClusters \
  --yes
```

You can also check if the extension was successfully removed by listing all extensions:

```bash
az k8s-extension list \
  --cluster-name <your-cluster-name> \
  --resource-group <your-resource-group> \
  --cluster-type managedClusters
```

The Flux extension should no longer appear in the output after successful deletion.
