It sounds like you're having a tough conversation about hiring decisions where you need to push back on candidates who don't meet your experience requirements. Here are some ways to communicate this more constructively:

**Focus on specific needs rather than rejecting people:**
"John, I've reviewed all three candidates, and while they each have potential, none of them align with our current business needs. We're at a point where we need engineers who can contribute immediately without a 3-6 month ramp-up period."

**Be clear about your constraints:**
"Given our current project timelines and team capacity, we specifically need candidates with 5+ years of hands-on experience who can hit the ground running from day one. My team is already stretched thin, and we can't afford the productivity gap that comes with extensive training right now."

**Suggest next steps:**
"Can we refocus our search on senior-level candidates? I'm happy to be more involved in the screening process upfront to ensure we're aligned on the experience level we need."

**If you want to soften it while staying firm:**
"I appreciate the effort in sourcing these candidates, but I think we need to recalibrate our search criteria. The skill gap between where these candidates are and where we need them to be is just too significant for our current situation."

This approach acknowledges the work that's been done while clearly communicating your non-negotiable requirements and suggesting a path forward.
