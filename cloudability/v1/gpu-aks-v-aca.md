For GPU-based workloads, here's a detailed comparison between Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Container Apps:

**Azure Container Apps GPU Support:**
- **Limited GPU availability** - Currently supports basic GPU workloads but with restrictions
- **Simplified management** - No cluster management overhead
- **Automatic scaling** - Can scale GPU instances based on demand
- **Cost model** - Pay-per-use for GPU time, good for sporadic GPU workloads
- **GPU types** - Limited selection of GPU SKUs available

**Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) GPU Support:**
- **Full GPU flexibility** - Supports wide range of NVIDIA GPU types (V100, A100, K80, etc.)
- **Better performance** - Direct GPU access, minimal virtualization overhead
- **Advanced scheduling** - GPU resource sharing, fractional GPU allocation
- **Specialized workloads** - Better support for ML training, HPC, rendering pipelines
- **GPU pooling** - Can mix different GPU types in same cluster

**Cost Comparison for GPU Workloads:**

**AKS is typically cheaper for:**
- **Sustained GPU usage** (hours to days of continuous processing)
- **Batch processing jobs** that can utilize full GPU capacity
- **Predictable workloads** where you can reserve GPU instances
- **Large-scale ML training** requiring multiple GPUs simultaneously

**Container Apps is cheaper for:**
- **Intermittent GPU tasks** (minutes to hours)
- **Event-driven GPU processing** 
- **Prototype/development** GPU workloads
- **Scenarios where cluster management overhead isn't justified**

**Technical Considerations:**
- **AKS**: Full control over GPU drivers, CUDA versions, multi-GPU setups
- **Container Apps**: Simplified but limited GPU configuration options
- **AKS**: Better for complex ML pipelines requiring GPU orchestration
- **Container Apps**: Better for simple GPU acceleration tasks

**Bottom Line for GPU Workloads:**
AKS is generally the better choice for serious GPU workloads due to better performance, flexibility, and cost efficiency at scale. Container Apps GPU support is still maturing and works best for lighter, intermittent GPU tasks.

For production ML training, data processing, or rendering workloads, **AKS with dedicated GPU node pools** typically provides 40-60% better cost-performance ratio than Container Apps.
