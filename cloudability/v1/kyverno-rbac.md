For your Kyverno policy to work properly, you'll need several RBAC permissions. Here are the key ones:

## Core Kyverno RBAC Requirements

**For the Kyverno Controller:**
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: kyverno-policy-controller
rules:
# Read VirtualServices to validate against existing ones
- apiGroups: ["networking.istio.io"]
  resources: ["virtualservices"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]

# Access to admission review requests
- apiGroups: ["admissionregistration.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["validatingadmissionconfigurations", "mutatingadmissionconfigurations"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]

# Events for policy violations
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["events"]
  verbs: ["create", "patch"]

# ConfigMaps for policy status
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["configmaps"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

## Specific Requirements for Your Policy

Your policy uses `apiCall` context, which requires additional permissions:

```yaml
# Additional permissions for API calls in context
- apiGroups: ["networking.istio.io"]
  resources: ["virtualservices"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
  # This allows the urlPath call: "/apis/networking.istio.io/v1/virtualservices"
```

## Service Account Setup

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: kyverno-service-account
  namespace: kyverno

---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: kyverno-binding
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: kyverno-policy-controller
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: kyverno-service-account
  namespace: kyverno
```

## Standard Kyverno Installation

If you're using the standard Kyverno Helm chart or YAML installation, most of these permissions are typically included. However, you should verify that the service account has access to:

1. **List VirtualServices cluster-wide** (since your policy checks across all namespaces)
2. **Read admission requests** for VirtualService resources
3. **Create events** for policy violations

The key permission your policy specifically needs is the ability to make the API call `"/apis/networking.istio.io/v1/virtualservices"` which requires `list` permissions on VirtualServices at the cluster level.
