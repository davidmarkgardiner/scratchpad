For managing this dual deployment setup during your transition from ARM to node-auto-provisioner with GitOps, here's a structured approach:

## Feature Flag Strategy

Implement feature flags at the cluster level to control which provisioning method each environment uses:

```yaml
# In your ARM template or GitOps config
parameters:
  useNodeAutoProvisioner: boolean = false
  environment: string
```

This allows you to gradually roll out the new feature while maintaining ARM compatibility.

## Dual Template Architecture

**Option 1: Conditional ARM Templates**
- Create ARM templates with conditional logic that deploys either traditional node pools OR enables node-auto-provisioner
- Use ARM template conditions based on parameters to switch between deployment modes
- Keep the same template structure but conditionally provision resources

**Option 2: Parallel Deployment Paths**
- Maintain separate ARM templates for legacy deployments
- Create new GitOps manifests for node-auto-provisioner clusters
- Use environment-specific configuration to determine which path to use

## Recommended GitOps Integration

**Repository Structure:**
```
├── arm-templates/
│   ├── legacy-cluster.json
│   └── transitional-cluster.json
├── gitops/
│   ├── cluster-configs/
│   ├── node-auto-provisioner/
│   └── applications/
└── environments/
    ├── engineering/
    ├── development/
    ├── preprod/
    └── production/
```

**Deployment Pipeline:**
1. **Engineering/Dev**: Use node-auto-provisioner + GitOps
2. **PreProd**: Test both methods for validation
3. **Production**: Maintain ARM until fully validated, then migrate

## Migration Strategy

**Phase 1**: Deploy node-auto-provisioner in engineering/dev
- ARM deploys base cluster
- GitOps manages node-auto-provisioner configuration
- Validate functionality and performance

**Phase 2**: Parallel operation in preprod
- Test both deployment methods
- Validate feature parity
- Performance benchmarking

**Phase 3**: Production migration
- Blue-green deployment approach
- Gradual migration of production workloads
- Rollback capability via ARM templates

## Key Implementation Considerations

**ARM Template Modifications:**
- Add node-auto-provisioner RBAC permissions
- Include necessary Azure policies
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing clusters

**GitOps Configuration:**
- Use ArgoCD or Flux for node-auto-provisioner manifests
- Implement proper RBAC for GitOps controllers
- Set up monitoring and alerting for both systems

**Monitoring Strategy:**
- Separate dashboards for ARM vs GitOps managed resources
- Cross-reference metrics during transition
- Set up alerts for provisioning failures in both systems

This approach gives you maximum flexibility to roll back if needed while providing a clear migration path forward. The key is maintaining clear separation between the two provisioning methods while they coexist.
