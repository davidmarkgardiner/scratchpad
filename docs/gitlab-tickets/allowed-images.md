# Migrate Container Image Allowlist from Azure Policy to Kyverno

## Summary
Migrate our container image allowlist from the current Azure Policy regex implementation to Kyverno policy. This migration will provide improved performance, better maintainability, and a more dynamic approach to container image validation.

## Background
Currently, our container image allowlist is managed through Azure Policy using regex patterns. This approach has several limitations:
- Slow implementation and deployment times
- Difficult to maintain and update the regex patterns
- Limited flexibility for complex validation rules
- Poor developer experience when troubleshooting

## Benefits of Kyverno
- **Kubernetes-native solution**: Kyverno operates directly within the Kubernetes cluster
- **Faster validation**: Significant reduction in policy evaluation time
- **Easier maintenance**: YAML-based policies are more readable and maintainable than regex
- **GitOps friendly**: Policies can be version-controlled and deployed through our existing GitOps pipeline
- **Dynamic updates**: Policy changes can be applied without lengthy deployment cycles
- **Rich validation capabilities**: Beyond simple pattern matching, Kyverno supports complex validation rules
- **Better developer experience**: Clear error messages and validation results
- **Audit capabilities**: Comprehensive logging and reporting

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Design
- [ ] Document current Azure Policy regex patterns and their purpose
- [ ] Identify all affected clusters and workloads
- [ ] Design equivalent Kyverno policies for container image validation
- [ ] Determine metrics for success (policy evaluation time, false positives/negatives)
- [ ] Create rollback plan

### Phase 2: Implementation
- [ ] Develop Kyverno policies in a test environment
  - [ ] Create YAML manifests for image validation policies
  - [ ] Implement flexibility for easy updates to the allowlist
  - [ ] Add appropriate annotations and documentation
- [ ] Configure GitOps pipeline for policy deployment
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for policy violations

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Deploy policies in non-production environment with audit mode enabled (no enforcement)
- [ ] Validate policy behavior against known good and bad images
- [ ] Test policy update process
- [ ] Conduct performance testing to measure impact
- [ ] Document any unexpected behaviors or edge cases

### Phase 4: Deployment
- [ ] Schedule migration window with stakeholders
- [ ] Deploy Kyverno policies in enforcement mode with temporary exceptions if needed
- [ ] Monitor for any unexpected blocking of legitimate workloads
- [ ] Keep Azure Policy active in audit-only mode temporarily
- [ ] Verify all legitimate workloads continue to function

### Phase 5: Finalization
- [ ] Collect metrics comparing Azure Policy vs Kyverno performance
- [ ] Disable and remove Azure Policy regex rules
- [ ] Document the new policy management process
- [ ] Train team members on managing Kyverno policies
- [ ] Create runbook for troubleshooting policy issues

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement Kyverno policies alongside existing Azure Policies (Kyverno in audit mode)
2. Validate Kyverno policies are working correctly in audit mode
3. Switch Kyverno to enforcement mode while keeping Azure Policies active
4. Monitor for issues for 1-2 weeks
5. Disable Azure Policies once confident in Kyverno implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Kyverno policies successfully block non-allowed container images
- All previously allowed container images continue to function
- Policy evaluation time is measurably faster than Azure Policy
- Process for updating the allowlist is documented and tested
- All relevant teams understand how to work with the new policy system

## Timeline
- Estimated implementation time: 2-3 weeks
- Estimated testing period: 1 week
- Full migration completion: 4-5 weeks
