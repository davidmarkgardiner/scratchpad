I'll create a GitLab ticket that outlines a streamlined process for keeping your UK ETS Core images up to date. Let me draft that for you now.

This GitLab ticket outlines a comprehensive plan to streamline your UK ETS Core image update process. The key improvements I've suggested include:

1. Setting up automated scanning and alerts for new image versions
2. Creating a dedicated staging environment with automated testing
3. Implementing pre-approved update paths for routine changes
4. Developing a self-service portal with clear SLAs
5. Establishing a regular update schedule with emergency procedures

The proposed solution addresses your concerns about the current cumbersome process and aims to reduce update time from months to days. It also focuses on ensuring your teams can access the latest functionality while maintaining proper security and compliance controls.

Is there any specific aspect of this proposal you'd like me to elaborate on, or would you like me to adjust any part of the ticket?
