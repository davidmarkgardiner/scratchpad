# Streamline UK ETS Core Image Update Process

## Title
Implement Automated Pipeline for UK ETS Core Image Updates

## Description
Our current process for updating UK ETS Core images is significantly hindering development and operational efficiency. Some images are already five versions behind the latest releases, causing compatibility issues and code errors when teams attempt to use newer functionality. We need to establish a streamlined, automated process that reduces manual intervention and administrative overhead.

## Current Issues
- Manual update process requiring excessive approvals
- Updates taking weeks or months to complete
- Developers experiencing code errors due to outdated dependencies
- Unable to utilize latest functionality in newer versions
- Some images currently 5+ versions behind latest releases

## Proposed Solution
Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline for UK ETS Core image updates with the following components:

1. **Automated Scanning System**
   - Set up automated monitoring of upstream image repositories
   - Configure alerts for new stable releases and security patches
   - Implement vulnerability scanning integration

2. **Staging Environment for Testing**
   - Create dedicated staging environment for image testing
   - Implement automated regression testing suite
   - Configure compatibility validation tests

3. **Pre-approved Update Paths**
   - Define policy for minor version updates to be pre-approved
   - Establish clear criteria for security patches to bypass standard approval process
   - Document exceptions requiring manual review

4. **Self-Service Portal**
   - Develop dashboard showing image versions and update status
   - Provide teams ability to request specific version updates
   - Implement approval workflow with SLA commitments

5. **Regular Update Schedule**
   - Establish monthly update cadence for non-critical updates
   - Define emergency update process for critical security patches
   - Schedule updates during off-peak hours to minimize disruption

## Success Criteria
- Reduce update process time from weeks/months to days
- Ensure images are never more than 1 version behind latest stable release
- Zero production incidents caused by outdated images
- 90% of security patches applied within 72 hours of release
- Measurable reduction in developer reported image-related issues

## Implementation Timeline
1. **Week 1-2**: Design automated pipeline architecture
2. **Week 3-4**: Implement scanning and notification system
3. **Week 5-6**: Set up staging environment and automated testing
4. **Week 7-8**: Develop self-service portal and approval workflows
5. **Week 9-10**: Testing, documentation, and training
6. **Week 11**: Go-live with new process

## Stakeholders
- Development Teams
- Security Team
- Operations Team
- Change Management Board
- Compliance Team

## Labels
`process-improvement`, `automation`, `devops`, `security`, `high-priority`

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: Automated updates introducing compatibility issues
  **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite in staging environment before promotion

- **Risk**: Security team concerns about reduced oversight
  **Mitigation**: Detailed logging, audit trails, and compliance reporting

- **Risk**: Initial implementation requiring significant resources
  **Mitigation**: Phased approach focusing on most critical images first

## Additional Notes
This initiative aligns with our organizational goals of increasing development velocity, improving security posture, and reducing operational overhead. The current process is creating bottlenecks that directly impact delivery timelines and system stability.
