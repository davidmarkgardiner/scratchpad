Here's a funny Teams message for you:

🎉 **BREAKING NEWS** 🎉

Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for **t08** - our very own cluster celebrity! 👏

Not only is t08 the *first* cluster at UBS to be built using Kubernetes Resource Orchestrator and Azure Service Operator, but he's also basically the Beyoncé of infrastructure as code. 💅

While other clusters are still out here manually clicking buttons like it's 2015, t08 rolled up like "Y'all still doing THAT?" 

He's a trendsetter. A visionary. A pioneer. The Christopher Columbus of cloud infrastructure (but, you know, with fewer ethical concerns and way better documentation).

t08 isn't just a cluster - he's a **lifestyle**. He's the future. He's that friend who had AirPods before anyone else knew what they were.

So next time you're deploying something boring on a legacy cluster, just remember: t08 is out there living his best automated life, orchestrating resources like a symphony conductor, and making the rest of our infrastructure look like cavemen drawing on walls. 🎻🎭

Welcome to the future, t08. We're not worthy. 🙇‍♂️
