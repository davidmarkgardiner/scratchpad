Let me help you troubleshoot this AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) memory insufficiency issue. First, let's understand why this might happen even when you don't seem to have many pods running.

Several factors could cause this:

1. Resource Requests and Limits
Check if your pods have high memory requests set:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocated resources"
```

2. System Reserved Memory
Each node reserves memory for system processes and kubelet. Check node allocatable resources:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 8 "Allocatable"
```

3. DaemonSets
DaemonSets run on every node and consume resources. List them:
```bash
kubectl get daemonsets --all-namespaces
```

To fix this, you can:

1. Check actual memory usage vs requests:
```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
```

2. Optimize resource requests:
- Review and adjust memory requests in your deployments
- Consider using vertical pod autoscaling (VPA) to right-size requests

3. Node scaling options:
- Increase node size (use larger VM sizes)
- Add more nodes to the cluster
- Enable cluster autoscaling if not already enabled

Would you like me to help you investigate any of these specific areas? I can provide more detailed commands for the area you want to focus on first.



If your resource limits are over 100%, that's definitely the issue. Let's analyze and fix this.

1. First, let's look at which pods are requesting the most resources:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 10 "Non-terminated Pods"
```

2. You can also get a sorted list of pods by memory requests:
```bash
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,MEMORY_REQUESTS:.spec.containers[*].resources.requests.memory,MEMORY_LIMITS:.spec.containers[*].resources.limits.memory
```

To fix this, you should:

1. Review and adjust memory limits in your deployments. For example, if you have a deployment:
```bash
kubectl edit deployment <deployment-name>
```
Look for and adjust these values:
```yaml
resources:
  limits:
    memory: "XXXMi"
  requests:
    memory: "XXXMi"
```

2. A good practice is to:
- Set requests to what the application actually needs
- Set limits to 1.5x or 2x the request value
- Monitor actual usage to fine-tune these values

Would you like me to help you analyze a specific deployment's resource configuration? Or would you like to see the actual memory usage of your pods to help determine appropriate values?
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,MEMORY_REQUESTS:.spec.containers[*].resources.requests.memory,MEMORY_LIMITS:.spec.containers[*].resources.limits.memory | grep "<none>"

kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o custom-columns=NAMESPACE:.metadata.namespace,NAME:.metadata.name,MEMORY_REQUESTS:.spec.containers[*].resources.requests.memory,MEMORY_LIMITS:.spec.containers[*].resources.limits.memory
