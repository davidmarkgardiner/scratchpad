Let me help you troubleshoot this AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) memory insufficiency issue. First, let's understand why this might happen even when you don't seem to have many pods running.

Several factors could cause this:

1. Resource Requests and Limits
Check if your pods have high memory requests set:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 5 "Allocated resources"
```

2. System Reserved Memory
Each node reserves memory for system processes and kubelet. Check node allocatable resources:
```bash
kubectl describe nodes | grep -A 8 "Allocatable"
```

3. DaemonSets
DaemonSets run on every node and consume resources. List them:
```bash
kubectl get daemonsets --all-namespaces
```

To fix this, you can:

1. Check actual memory usage vs requests:
```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods --all-namespaces
```

2. Optimize resource requests:
- Review and adjust memory requests in your deployments
- Consider using vertical pod autoscaling (VPA) to right-size requests

3. Node scaling options:
- Increase node size (use larger VM sizes)
- Add more nodes to the cluster
- Enable cluster autoscaling if not already enabled

Would you like me to help you investigate any of these specific areas? I can provide more detailed commands for the area you want to focus on first.
