I'll create a concise document about AKS storage options, highlighting the ephemeral storage aspects and storage account flexibility.

# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Storage Options

## Ephemeral Storage
- Available out-of-the-box using Kubernetes `emptyDir` volumes
- Data is stored on the node's temporary storage
- **Important**: Nothing is written to Azure Storage - all data exists only on the local VM
- Perfect for:
  - Scratch space
  - Temporary processing files
  - Short-lived session data

Example:
```yaml
volumes:
- name: scratch-volume
  emptyDir: {}
```

## Persistent Storage Options

### Azure Managed Disks
- Block storage for single pod access
- Support for Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Ultra Disk
- **Can use existing storage accounts**: You can bring your own managed disks and storage accounts
- Best for: Databases, high-IOPS workloads

### Azure Files
- SMB/NFS file share support
- Multiple pods can access simultaneously
- **Can use existing storage accounts**: You can pre-create shares and storage accounts
- Best for: Shared configuration, cross-pod data sharing

### Azure Blob Storage
- Object storage mounted via CSI driver
- Supports NFS v3 protocol
- **Can use existing storage accounts**: You can connect to pre-existing blob containers
- Best for: Large-scale unstructured data

## Performance Considerations
- Premium storage recommended for production workloads
- Azure Files Premium for shared file access
- Azure NetApp Files for highest performance requirements

## Security
- Support for Private Link
- Microsoft Entra ID integration
- RBAC controls at storage account level

Let me know if you'd like me to expand on any of these aspects or provide specific configuration examples.
