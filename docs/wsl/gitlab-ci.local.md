I'll help you install gitlab-ci-local on WSL. Let's break down the process step by step:

First, let's check if the repository exists and get information about it:

Now, let's look at the repository contents to understand how to install it:

Now that I have examined the repository, I'll provide you with step-by-step instructions to install gitlab-ci-local on WSL. Based on the repository information, there are several ways to install it, and I'll show you the best approach for WSL.

## Installing gitlab-ci-local on WSL

Since WSL is based on Linux, you have a few options. I'll provide multiple methods - you can choose the one that works best for your setup:

### Method 1: Using npm (Recommended for WSL)

This is the simplest method if you already have Node.js installed in your WSL environment:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js 18 or higher installed in your WSL:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```

2. If Node.js is not installed or is below version 18, install it:
   ```bash
   # Using NVM (Node Version Manager) - recommended
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   # Close and reopen your terminal or run
   source ~/.bashrc
   # Install Node.js 18
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   ```

3. Install gitlab-ci-local globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g gitlab-ci-local
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   gitlab-ci-local --version
   ```

### Method 2: Using Debian Package (If you're using a Debian-based WSL distro)

If you're using a Debian-based distribution in WSL (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.):

```bash
# Add the repository
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab-ci-local.sources https://gitlab-ci-local-ppa.firecow.dk/gitlab-ci-local.sources
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ci-local
```

If your distribution doesn't support the Deb822 format, use:

```bash
curl -s "https://gitlab-ci-local-ppa.firecow.dk/pubkey.gpg" | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://gitlab-ci-local-ppa.firecow.dk ./" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gitlab-ci-local.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ci-local
```

### Method 3: Building from Source

If you want to build it from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/firecow/gitlab-ci-local.git
cd gitlab-ci-local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Create a symbolic link to make it globally available
npm link
```

## Setup for Convenient Use

After installation, I recommend setting up these conveniences:

### Add a Bash Alias

```bash
echo "alias gcl='gitlab-ci-local'" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Enable Tab Completion

```bash
gitlab-ci-local --completion >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Testing Your Installation

Once installed, you can test if it's working by running:

```bash
gitlab-ci-local --version
# Or if you set up the alias
gcl --version
```

Let me know which method you'd prefer to use or if you encounter any issues during installation!
