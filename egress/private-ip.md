Yes, this example specifically demonstrates using private IPs for egress traffic in an AKS cluster. The key features shown are:

1. It uses private egress IPs from a dedicated small subnet (10.225.0.0/28) in the same VNET as the AKS cluster
2. Pods can:
   - Access the internet via default Azure networking route
   - Use static private egress IP(s) when accessing specific private RFC-1918 destinations (like on-premises networks)

The main benefit is that you can have predictable and narrower set of private IPs for egress traffic from the AKS cluster, which is useful for:
- Setting up firewall rules to allow traffic to on-premises networks
- Accessing other private destinations
- Avoiding the need to whitelist the entire AKS subnet CIDR range

The example demonstrates this by:
1. Creating two VNETs - one for AKS and one for a target network
2. Setting up a dedicated subnet (10.225.0.0/28) for egress IPs
3. Using the `kube-egress-gateway` project to manage the static egress
4. Showing how traffic appears from the egress subnet IP (10.225.0.x) instead of the default AKS subnet IP (10.224.0.x)

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
