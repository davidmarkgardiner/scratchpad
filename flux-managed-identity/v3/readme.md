You're absolutely right! Managing one managed identity per environment rather than per cluster is much more scalable and manageable. Here's an updated approach:Now here's the **one-time CLI setup script** to create shared managed identities per environment:And here's a **simple deployment script** for each cluster:## Benefits of This Shared Identity Approach:

### ✅ **Scalability Benefits:**
- **4 identities** instead of 100s (one per environment)
- **Centralized management** in a single resource group
- **Consistent permissions** across all clusters in an environment
- **Easier auditing** and compliance

### ✅ **Operational Benefits:**
- **One-time ADO setup** per environment instead of per cluster
- **Simplified credential rotation** (if ever needed)
- **Environment-specific permissions** possible
- **Cost reduction** (fewer resources to manage)

### ✅ **Security Benefits:**
- **Environment isolation** (dev clusters can't access prod repos)
- **Consistent security model** across environments
- **Centralized identity governance**

## Usage Workflow:

**1. One-time setup (Platform Team):**
```bash
# Run once to create shared identities
./setup-shared-identities.sh
# Manually add identities to Azure DevOps (4 users instead of 100s)
```

**2. Per-cluster deployment (App Teams):**
```bash
# Deploy to any cluster using shared identity
./deploy-cluster-flux.sh myapp-prod-rg myapp-cluster-01 prod
./deploy-cluster-flux.sh myapp-prod-rg myapp-cluster-02 prod
./deploy-cluster-flux.sh myapp-dev-rg myapp-dev-cluster dev
```

**3. Each deployment automatically:**
- Creates a unique federated credential for that cluster
- Reuses the shared managed identity
- Configures Flux with proper workload identity

## Repository Structure Recommendation:

```
k8s-manifests/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── infrastructure/
│   │   └── applications/
│   ├── test/
│   │   ├── infrastructure/
│   │   └── applications/
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── infrastructure/
│   │   └── applications/
│   └── prod/
│       ├── infrastructure/
│       └── applications/
└── shared/
    ├── base/
    └── components/
```

This approach scales much better and reduces your management overhead significantly!
