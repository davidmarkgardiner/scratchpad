I'll help you install the Flux CLI on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. First, make sure your WSL instance is up-to-date:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

2. Install the GPG prerequisites if not already installed:
```bash
sudo apt install -y gnupg2 curl apt-transport-https
```

3. Add the Flux GPG key:
```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh | sudo bash
```

This script will:
- Add the Flux GPG key
- Add the Flux repository to your sources
- Install the Flux CLI

Alternatively, if you prefer to install a specific version or manually:

```bash
curl -s https://fluxcd.io/install.sh > install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

4. Verify the installation:
```bash
flux --version
```

5. If you're planning to use Flux with GitHub, you might want to set up a personal access token:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of using Flux CLI with WSL?
