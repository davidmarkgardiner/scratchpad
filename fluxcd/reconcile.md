Great to hear it's working after deletion! Here's how you can force reconciliation and run health checks:

### Force Reconciliation

1. Force reconcile the specific HelmRelease:
```bash
flux reconcile helmrelease uk8s-core -n uk8s-core
```

2. Or reconcile the parent source:
```bash
flux reconcile source helm uk8s-core -n uk8s-core
```

3. For a complete reconciliation of your entire Flux system:
```bash
flux reconcile kustomization flux-system -n flux-system
```

### Health Checks

1. Check overall Flux system health:
```bash
flux check
```

2. Verify all Flux controllers are running:
```bash
kubectl -n flux-system get pods
```

3. Check for errors across all Flux resources:
```bash
flux get all -A
```

4. Examine the health of your HelmRelease:
```bash
flux get helmrelease uk8s-core -n uk8s-core
```

5. Validate Helm chart itself:
```bash
helm list -n uk8s-core
helm status uk8s-core -n uk8s-core
```

6. Check actual deployed resources:
```bash
kubectl get all -n uk8s-core
```

7. For potential networking issues, check services:
```bash
kubectl get svc -n uk8s-core
```

8. Monitor new events:
```bash
kubectl get events -n uk8s-core --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

If the reconciliation completes successfully, you should see the HelmRelease move to a "Ready: True" state.
