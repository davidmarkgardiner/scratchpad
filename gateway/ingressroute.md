For Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with an Application Gateway Ingress Controller (AGIC), the behavior is a bit different than with Istio. Let me explain how Gateway and VirtualService resources work in the context of AGIC.

In AKS with Application Gateway, the Gateway resources are typically managed by the Azure Application Gateway Kubernetes Ingress Controller (AGIC). You can use different namespaces for your Gateway and VirtualService resources, but there are specific considerations.

Here's an example of how to set this up properly:

```yaml
# Gateway in namespace "ingress-system"
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: aks-gateway
  namespace: ingress-system
spec:
  gatewayClassName: azure-application-gateway
  listeners:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
    hostname: example.com
```

```yaml
# VirtualService in namespace "my-app"
apiVersion: networking.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: HTTPRoute  # Note: Using HTTPRoute resource which is equivalent to VirtualService in this context
metadata:
  name: my-service-route
  namespace: my-app
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: aks-gateway
    namespace: ingress-system  # Cross-namespace reference
  hostnames:
  - "example.com"
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /
    forwardTo:
    - serviceName: my-service
      port: 8080
```

Common reasons for the error you're seeing:

1. **Missing namespace reference**: When referencing a Gateway from another namespace, you must explicitly include the namespace in the reference as shown above.

2. **Permission issues**: Ensure that RBAC permissions allow cross-namespace references. You might need a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.

3. **Timing issues**: The Gateway needs to be fully deployed and ready before VirtualServices can reference it.

4. **Version compatibility**: Ensure you're using compatible versions of the Gateway and VirtualService/HTTPRoute APIs.

To troubleshoot:

```bash
# Check Gateway status
kubectl get gateway -A

# Check if AGIC is properly configured
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ingress

# Check AGIC logs
kubectl logs -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep ingress | awk '{print $1}')
```

If you could share the exact error message and possibly the YAML of your resources (with sensitive information redacted), I could provide more specific guidance.
