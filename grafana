I'll help restructure and clarify this content in markdown format:

# Azure Monitoring & Grafana Architecture Design

## Current State
- Single cluster connected to single Azure Monitor workspace
- Central Grafana instances for visualization

## Design Considerations

### Azure Monitor Workspace Strategy
- Evaluate workspace consolidation options
- Optimize central Grafana placement for latency reduction

### App RBAC Requirements
- Grafana SAMI need Monitoring Reader role on Azure Monitor Workspace
- Automate RBAC assignment process if possible

### User RBAC Requirements
- Required role: Grafana Viewer
- Create dedicated BBS groups to prevent AKS role pullution via SWCI
- Consider user licensing costs ($6/user)

### Implementation
- Existing CI/CD pipeline handles Grafana dashboard deployment

## Questions to Address
1. Optimal Azure Monitor workspace consolidation strategy?
2. Best placement for central Grafana instances?
3. Chargeback model for Grafana user?
4. Additional automation requirements?
