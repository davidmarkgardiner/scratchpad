I'll provide you with alternative ways to write a Kyverno policy that only applies to images starting with "my.registry.com/" while excluding others like "test.my.registry.com".

Here's a better approach using the `startsWith` function:

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ startsWith(request.object.spec.containers[0].image, 'my.registry.com/') }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: true
```

This directly checks if the container image path starts with exactly "my.registry.com/" which will match "my.registry.com/image" but not "test.my.registry.com/image".

Another alternative using regex pattern matching:

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ regex_match('^my\\.registry\\.com/', request.object.spec.containers[0].image) }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: true
```

This uses a regex pattern to match only strings that start with exactly "my.registry.com/" at the beginning (the ^ anchor ensures it's at the start of the string).

If you need to check across multiple containers, you could use:

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ any(request.object.spec.containers[*].image, '@', startsWith(@, 'my.registry.com/')) }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: true
```

Would you like me to explain any of these approaches in more detail?

Looking at the official Kyverno documentation you've shared, I see there are more options we can try. Let's explore alternative approaches for your specific use case of matching images starting with "my.registry.com/" while excluding others.

Based on the documentation, here are some better approaches:

## 1. Using JMESPath startsWith function

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ startsWith(request.object.spec.containers[0].image, 'my.registry.com/') }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: true
```

## 2. Using a wildcard pattern with AnyIn operator

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ request.object.spec.containers[0].image }}"
    operator: AnyIn
    value: 
    - "my.registry.com/*"
```

## 3. Using the Equals operator with wildcard match

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ request.object.spec.containers[0].image }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: "my.registry.com/*"
```

## 4. Checking multiple containers with JMESPath

If you need to check all containers in a pod:

```yaml
preconditions:
  all:
  - key: "{{ any(request.object.spec.containers[*].image, '@', startsWith(@, 'my.registry.com/')) }}"
    operator: Equals
    value: true
```

If the regex approach was not working for you, these alternative methods might help. The wildcard pattern with AnyIn or the startsWith function are likely your best options based on the documentation.
