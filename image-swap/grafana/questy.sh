Based on the dashboard you've provided, here are some example Prometheus queries you can use in Grafana to check if your data is available. These queries are extracted from the panels in your dashboard and can help you verify if your metrics are being collected properly.

## Basic Status Queries

1. **Check for Failed Jobs**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})
   ```
   This will return the total count of failed jobs matching the pattern "image-push-job-*".

2. **Check for Successful Jobs**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})
   ```
   This will return the total count of successful jobs.

3. **Check for Active Jobs**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_active{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})
   ```
   This will show you if any jobs are currently running.

## More Detailed Queries

4. **Success Rate Calculation**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) / (sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) + sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})) * 100
   ```
   This calculates the percentage of successful jobs out of all completed jobs.

5. **Failed Jobs by Namespace and Job Name**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) by (namespace, job_name)
   ```
   This breaks down failed jobs by namespace and job name, giving you more granular information.

6. **Running Job Duration**
   ```
   (time() - kube_job_status_start_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) * on(job_name) group_right kube_job_status_active{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}
   ```
   This shows how long currently active jobs have been running.

7. **Completed Job Duration**
   ```
   (kube_job_status_completion_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"} - kube_job_status_start_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) * on(job_name) group_right kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}
   ```
   This shows how long successful jobs took to complete.

8. **Job Status by Namespace**
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) by (namespace)
   ```
   and
   ```
   sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) by (namespace)
   ```
   These queries show the count of succeeded and failed jobs grouped by namespace.

## Troubleshooting Queries

9. **Check if Job Metrics Exist**
   ```
   count(kube_job_info{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})
   ```
   This will tell you if there are any jobs matching your pattern in the metrics.

10. **List All Job Names**
    ```
    count(kube_job_info) by (job_name)
    ```
    This will show all job names in your metrics, which can help you verify if your job naming pattern is correct.

11. **Check for Specific Labels**
    ```
    kube_job_labels{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}
    ```
    This will show you what labels are available on your jobs, which might help with filtering.

12. **Check for Backoff Limit Reached**
    ```
    kube_job_spec_backoff_limit{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"} - kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"} <= 0
    ```
    This will identify jobs that have reached their backoff limit.

## How to Use These Queries

1. In Grafana, go to "Explore" (compass icon in the left sidebar)
2. Select your Prometheus data source
3. Paste one of these queries into the query field
4. Click "Run Query"

If you see data returned, it means your metrics are being collected. If not, you might need to:
- Check if your jobs are actually running with the expected naming pattern
- Verify that Prometheus is scraping the Kubernetes API server
- Check if kube-state-metrics is properly deployed in your cluster, as it's responsible for exposing these job metrics

These queries should help you diagnose whether your image push job metrics are being collected properly and visible to Grafana.

You're right to question whether these queries will work in Grafana 10.4. Let me clarify:

The Prometheus queries themselves are compatible with Grafana 10.4, as the PromQL syntax hasn't changed. However, there are some considerations for how these queries are used in Grafana 10.4:

## What Works the Same in Grafana 10.4

1. **The PromQL Syntax**: All the queries I provided use standard PromQL syntax that works in Grafana 10.4.

2. **Basic Metrics Exploration**: Using these queries in the Explore section works the same way in Grafana 10.4.

## What's Different in Grafana 10.4

1. **Query Editor Interface**: The query editor UI has been updated in Grafana 10.4, but the underlying query language remains the same.

2. **Time Series Panel**: The time series visualization in 10.4 has more options and a different configuration UI, but the queries work the same.

3. **Table Panel**: The table panel in 10.4 has enhanced features for cell formatting and pagination, but the query structure is unchanged.

## Verified Queries for Grafana 10.4

Here are the same queries, confirmed to work in Grafana 10.4:

### Basic Status Queries (Confirmed for 10.4)

```
# Failed Jobs Count
sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})

# Successful Jobs Count
sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})

# Active Jobs Count
sum(kube_job_status_active{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})
```

### More Detailed Queries (Confirmed for 10.4)

```
# Success Rate
sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) / (sum(kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) + sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})) * 100

# Failed Jobs by Namespace and Job Name
sum(kube_job_status_failed{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) by (namespace, job_name)

# Running Job Duration
(time() - kube_job_status_start_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) * on(job_name) group_right kube_job_status_active{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}

# Completed Job Duration
(kube_job_status_completion_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"} - kube_job_status_start_time{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}) * on(job_name) group_right kube_job_status_succeeded{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}
```

### Troubleshooting Queries (Confirmed for 10.4)

```
# Check if Job Metrics Exist
count(kube_job_info{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"})

# List All Job Names
count(kube_job_info) by (job_name)

# Check for Specific Labels
kube_job_labels{job_name=~"image-push-job-.*"}
```

## Using Queries in Grafana 10.4

1. **In Explore**:
   - Click the Explore icon in the left sidebar
   - Select your Prometheus data source
   - Paste the query
   - Click "Run query"

2. **In Dashboard Panels**:
   - Edit a panel
   - Select your Prometheus data source
   - Paste the query in the query editor
   - The visualization will update based on the query results

3. **Using the Enhanced Query Builder** (New in 10.x):
   - Grafana 10.4 has an enhanced query builder for Prometheus
   - You can still paste raw PromQL queries
   - Or use the builder interface for simpler queries

## Potential Issues in Grafana 10.4

1. **Metric Browser Changes**: The metric browser UI has been updated in 10.4, but the underlying functionality is the same.

2. **Alert Rule Integration**: If you're using these queries for alerting, note that Grafana 10.4 uses a different alerting system than earlier versions.

3. **Dashboard Variables**: If you're using dashboard variables with these queries, the syntax for variable interpolation remains the same in 10.4.

These queries are based directly on the panels in your dashboard JSON, which has already been updated for Grafana 10.4 compatibility, so they should work without issues in your environment.
