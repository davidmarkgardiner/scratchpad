I'll create a simple Helm chart for your whisky-app deployment. A Helm chart is composed of several files organized in a specific directory structure. Let me create this for you.

I've created a simple Helm chart for your whisky-app deployment. The chart includes the following files:

1. **Chart.yaml**: Contains the metadata for your Helm chart
2. **values.yaml**: Stores the default configuration values that can be overridden
3. **templates/deployment.yaml**: The Kubernetes deployment template with values parameterized
4. **templates/service.yaml**: A service to expose your application
5. **templates/_helpers.tpl**: Helper templates for generating consistent names and labels

The Helm chart structure follows best practices:
- All configuration is parameterized in the values.yaml file
- The deployment template uses the exact specifications from your original deployment
- Helper templates are used for consistent naming and labeling
- The service is configured properly to expose the application

To use this chart:
1. Create the directory structure as shown in the comments at the top
2. Place each file in its respective location
3. Deploy with: `helm install whisky-app ./whisky-app`

You can customize the deployment by overriding values:
```
helm install whisky-app ./whisky-app --set replicaCount=5
```

Or by creating a custom values file:
```
helm install whisky-app ./whisky-app -f my-values.yaml
```

This chart maintains all your security context settings, resource limits, and deployment strategy while providing flexibility for future changes.
