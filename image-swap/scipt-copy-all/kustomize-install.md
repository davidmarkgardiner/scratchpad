I'll help you install Kustomize on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Let me search for the most up-to-date installation instructions.

Here are several methods to install Kustomize on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux):

## Method 1: Using the installation script (Recommended)

The easiest way to install Kustomize on WSL is by using the official installation script:

```bash
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh" | bash
sudo mv kustomize /usr/local/bin
```

This script will automatically download the latest version of Kustomize, and then we move it to your system's PATH.

## Method 2: Using Snap (for Ubuntu-based WSL)

If you're running Ubuntu in your WSL, you can install Kustomize using Snap:

```bash
sudo snap install kustomize
```

## Method 3: Manual download and installation

You can manually download a specific version and install it:

```bash
wget https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/download/kustomize/v3.8.5/kustomize_v3.8.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf kustomize_v3.8.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv kustomize /usr/local/bin/
```

You may want to check the latest version available on the GitHub releases page and update the version number in the command above.

## Method 4: Using Kubectl (if you already have it installed)

If you already have kubectl installed, you can use its built-in Kustomize functionality with the `-k` flag instead of installing Kustomize separately:

```bash
kubectl apply -k <directory>
```

However, the standalone Kustomize tool often has more features and is more up-to-date than the version embedded in kubectl.

## Verify the installation

After installation, verify that Kustomize is correctly installed by running:

```bash
kustomize version
```

This should display the version information for your Kustomize installation.
