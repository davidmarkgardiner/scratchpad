# AKS Multi-Cluster Helm Deployment with Workload Identity

## Description

We need to implement an Azure DevOps pipeline that deploys a Helm chart across multiple AKS clusters. The pipeline should set up workload identity for each cluster, allowing the deployed application to access secrets from a central Azure Key Vault.

## Objectives

- Create a reusable, scalable deployment pipeline for multiple AKS clusters
- Implement Azure Workload Identity for secure authentication to Key Vault
- Establish consistent deployment process across all environments
- Automate the creation and configuration of required Azure resources

## Proposed Solution

A pipeline has been created that:
1. Accepts a list of AKS clusters as input
2. Sets up workload identity on each cluster
3. Creates and configures managed identities with proper access to Key Vault
4. Deploys the Helm chart with the necessary identity information
5. Verifies deployment success and generates deployment reports

You can review the initial implementation in:

- [deployment-architecture.md](link-to-file)
- [README.md](link-to-file)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Preparation (Week 1)
- [ ] Review and verify AKS cluster OIDC issuer setup
- [ ] Create Azure DevOps service connection with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Set up variable group with required configuration
- [ ] Test and validate service principal access to resources

### Phase 2: Pipeline Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement the pipeline in a development environment
- [ ] Test with a single AKS cluster
- [ ] Validate Workload Identity configuration
- [ ] Verify application can access Key Vault

### Phase 3: Rollout (Week 3)
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Conduct security review of the implementation
- [ ] Document operational procedures
- [ ] Deploy to production environment

## Technical Considerations

### Service Principal Requirements
The Azure DevOps service connection requires the following permissions:
- AKS Admin role for cluster management
- Managed Identity Operator role for identity management
- Key Vault Administrator for secret access policy configuration

### Helm Chart Requirements
- The Helm chart must support Azure Workload Identity
- Chart values should accept identity client ID and Key Vault parameters
- Service account configuration should be customizable

### Security Considerations
- Each cluster gets its own managed identity
- Federated identity credentials limit access to specific Kubernetes service accounts
- Key Vault access is limited to specific secrets only

## Questions for Discussion

1. Should we implement a progressive rollout strategy or deploy to all clusters at once?
2. Do we have any existing Helm chart customizations that need to be preserved?
3. Should we implement additional monitoring for the workload identity authentication?
4. What is our rollback strategy if deployment fails on some clusters?
5. How will we handle rotation of Key Vault secrets?
