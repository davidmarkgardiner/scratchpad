I'd be happy to help you install and run the ORAS (OCI Registry As Storage) CLI with the manifest fetch command on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Let me walk you through the steps.

First, let's install ORAS on your WSL environment:

1. Open your WSL terminal if it's not already open.

2. Let's install ORAS using one of these methods:

## Method 1: Using the install script (recommended)

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/oras-project/oras/releases/download/v1.1.0/oras_1.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p oras-install/
tar -zxf oras_1.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C oras-install/
sudo mv oras-install/oras /usr/local/bin/
rm -rf oras_1.1.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz oras-install/
```

## Method 2: Using Go (if you have Go installed)

```bash
go install github.com/oras-project/oras/cmd/oras@latest
```

3. Verify the installation:

```bash
oras version
```

Now let's run the manifest fetch command. The basic syntax is:

```bash
oras manifest fetch [options] <name>{:<tag>|@<digest>}
```

For example, to fetch a manifest from a public registry:

```bash
oras manifest fetch docker.io/library/alpine:latest
```

Or if you need to authenticate to a private registry first:

```bash
# Login to registry
oras login -u username -p password registry.example.com

# Then fetch the manifest
oras manifest fetch registry.example.com/myrepo/myimage:latest
```

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this process in more detail? Or do you have a specific registry and image you want to fetch the manifest from?
