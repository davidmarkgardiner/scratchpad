Here's a suggested structure for policy names:
`{type}-{scope}-{resource}-{action}`

Where:
- `type` would be:
  - `enforce` for enforcement policies
  - `audit` for audit policies
  - `mutate` for mutation policies
  - `validate` for validation policies
  - `generate` for generation policies

- `scope` indicates the cluster scope like:
  - `cluster` for cluster-wide policies
  - `ns` for namespace-specific policies

- `resource` is the Kubernetes resource type being targeted (pod, deployment, service, etc.)

- `action` describes what the policy does

For example:
```yaml
# Enforces pod security
enforce-cluster-pod-security

# Audits image repositories
audit-ns-image-registry

# Mutates pod labels
mutate-cluster-pod-labels

# Validates deployment replicas
validate-ns-deployment-replicas

# Generates network policies
generate-ns-networkpolicy-default
```
