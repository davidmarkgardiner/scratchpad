I'll help you set up SSH authentication for GitLab. Here are the steps:

1. First, check if you already have an SSH key pair on your system:
```bash
ls -la ~/.ssh
```
Look for files named `id_rsa` (private key) and `id_rsa.pub` (public key).

2. If you don't have an SSH key, generate one:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```
Or if your system doesn't support Ed25519:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

3. Copy your public key:
```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# or if you used RSA:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

4. Add the key to GitLab:
   - Log in to GitLab
   - Click on your profile picture â†’ Settings
   - Click on "SSH Keys" in the left sidebar
   - Paste your public key in the "Key" field
   - Add a descriptive title
   - Click "Add key"

5. Test your connection:
```bash
ssh -T git@gitlab.com
```

You should see a welcome message confirming successful authentication. Now you can use SSH URLs for cloning and pushing to repositories.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
