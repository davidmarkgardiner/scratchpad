Got it. Since the labels are now updated but you're still not seeing metrics in Grafana, let's look at other potential issues. Since this is on another cluster (not local), I'll provide you with troubleshooting steps you can run there.

Here are the next debugging steps to try:

1. First, verify the ServiceMonitor is being picked up by Prometheus:

```bash
kubectl get servicemonitor -n kyverno kyverno-service-monitor
```

2. Check if the Prometheus operator is configured to watch the kyverno namespace:

```bash
kubectl get prometheus -A -o yaml | grep namespaceSelector -A5
```

3. Verify the service endpoints are actually available:

```bash
kubectl get endpoints -n kyverno kyverno-svc
```

4. Check if the metrics port is actually exposed on the Kyverno pods:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kyverno -l app.kubernetes.io/component=admission-controller -o wide
kubectl describe pod -n kyverno <pod-name-from-above>
```

5. Try to access the metrics endpoint directly to see if it's responding:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n kyverno svc/kyverno-svc 8000:8000
# In another terminal
curl localhost:8000/metrics
```

6. Check Prometheus logs for any scraping errors:

```bash
kubectl logs -n <prometheus-namespace> <prometheus-pod-name> -c prometheus
```

7. Verify the "release: prometheus-stack" label on your ServiceMonitor matches what your Prometheus instance is looking for:

```bash
kubectl get prometheus -A -o yaml | grep serviceMonitorSelector -A5
```

8. Make sure the metrics port name in your service matches the port name in the Kyverno deployment:

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n kyverno -o yaml | grep -A10 ports
```

The most common issues are:

1. The ServiceMonitor isn't being picked up by Prometheus (wrong labels or namespace configuration)
2. The service selector doesn't match the pod labels
3. The metrics endpoint isn't actually exposed or working on the pods
4. The port names don't match between service and deployment

Let me know what you find from these checks and we can narrow down the issue further.
