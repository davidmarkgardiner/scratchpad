## Tasks Breakdown

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Create and configure node pools in AKS
  - [ ] Worker node pool
  - [ ] Spot node pool
  - [ ] GPU node pool
- [ ] Apply node labels to each pool
  - [ ] `node-type=worker`
  - [ ] `node-type=spot`
  - [ ] `node-type=gpu`
- [ ] Verify node pool configuration and labels

### Kyverno Implementation
- [ ] Install/upgrade Kyverno in the cluster
- [ ] Develop Kyverno policies for node affinity
  - [ ] Worker node policy
  - [ ] Spot node policy
  - [ ] GPU node policy
- [ ] Test policies in development environment
- [ ] Document policy configuration

### Namespace Management
- [ ] Define namespace labeling strategy
  - [ ] Create label schema documentation
  - [ ] Define standard labels (workload-type, team, env)
- [ ] Create test namespaces with labels
- [ ] Verify label-based routing works as expected

### Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create test workloads for each node type
- [ ] Verify correct placement of workloads
- [ ] Document testing results
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### Documentation & Training
- [ ] Create technical documentation
- [ ] Create team onboarding guide
- [ ] Prepare training materials
- [ ] Schedule team training sessions

### Rollout
- [ ] Create rollout plan
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Perform staged rollout to teams
- [ ] Post-implementation review

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Kyverno policies successfully route workloads based on namespace labels
2. All node pools are properly labeled and configured
3. Documentation is complete and reviewed
4. Test workloads deploy successfully to correct node pools
5. Monitoring is in place for policy enforcement
6. Team training materials are created and reviewed
7. Rollout plan is approved by stakeholders

## Technical Requirements
- AKS cluster version: 1.25+
- Kyverno version: 1.10+
- Node pools configured with appropriate VM sizes
- Monitoring tools integrated (Prometheus/Grafana)

## Dependencies
- AKS cluster access and permissions
- Node pool capacity planning completed
- Team namespace structure approved
- Security team review of Kyverno policies

## References
- [Architecture Design Document]
- [Kyverno Documentation](https://kyverno.io/docs/)
- [AKS Node Pool Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-multiple-node-pools)

## Time Estimate
- Planning: 1 day
- Implementation: 3 days
- Testing: 2 days
- Documentation: 2 days
- Training: 1 day
- Rollout: 3 days

## Risk Assessment
- **Medium**: Node pool capacity management
- **Low**: Policy conflicts with existing configurations
- **Low**: Team adoption and training needs

## Additional Notes
- Consider backup placement strategy if Kyverno policy fails
- Plan for regular policy audits
- Consider automation for namespace creation
- Document emergency override procedures
