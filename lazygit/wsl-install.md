To install LazyGit on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), you'd follow a slightly different process than on Mac. Here's how to do it:

## Installing LazyGit on WSL

### Method 1: Using the Debian/Ubuntu package manager
If you're using a Debian/Ubuntu-based WSL distribution:

```bash
# Update your package lists
sudo apt update

# Install required dependencies
sudo apt install git curl

# Download the latest release (replace X.X with the latest version number)
LAZYGIT_VERSION=$(curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest" | grep -Po '"tag_name": "v\K[^"]*')

# Download the Linux binary
curl -Lo lazygit.tar.gz "https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/releases/latest/download/lazygit_${LAZYGIT_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"

# Extract the archive
tar xf lazygit.tar.gz lazygit

# Move the binary to your PATH
sudo install lazygit /usr/local/bin

# Clean up the downloaded files
rm lazygit.tar.gz lazygit
```

### Method 2: Using Go (if you have Go installed)
```bash
go install github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit@latest
```

### Method 3: Using a package manager in other WSL distributions
If you're using another distribution in WSL, you can use its respective package manager:

For Arch-based distros:
```bash
sudo pacman -S lazygit
```

For Fedora/RHEL-based distros:
```bash
sudo dnf install lazygit
```

After installation, you can launch LazyGit in any Git repository by simply typing `lazygit` in your WSL terminal, and all the features and keybindings will work exactly the same as described in the Mac guide I provided earlier.
