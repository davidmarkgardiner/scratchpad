Let me help you calculate this. Let's think about this step by step:

1. First, let's define what "reasonable" resource requests might be for a typical pod:
   - For a typical microservice/application pod, reasonable CPU requests often range from 100m (0.1 CPU) to 500m (0.5 CPU)
   - Memory requests typically range from 256Mi to 1Gi for standard applications

2. Let's calculate using a middle-ground scenario:
   - CPU: 250m (0.25 CPU) per pod
   - Memory: 512Mi (0.5Gi) per pod

3. With namespace limits of:
   - CPU: 8 CPU
   - Memory: 64Gi

4. Maximum pods based on CPU:
   - 8 CPU = 8000m
   - 8000m รท 250m = 32 pods

5. Maximum pods based on Memory:
   - 64Gi รท 0.5Gi = 128 pods

Therefore, in this scenario, CPU would be the limiting factor. You could technically deploy around 32 pods with these reasonable resource requests.

However, it's important to note:
- You should leave some headroom for system overhead
- Not all pods will have identical resource needs
- You might want to keep some capacity free for scaling during peak loads

A more conservative real-world estimate might be 20-25 pods to maintain system stability and allow for scaling.

Would you like me to calculate different scenarios with other resource request sizes?
