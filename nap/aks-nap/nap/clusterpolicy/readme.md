I'll help you break down the single policy into 4 separate policies for better management and clarity. I'll create each one focusing on its specific workload type.

I've broken down the policy into 4 separate policies, each with its specific focus. Here's a summary of each:

1. **Batch Policy** (`batch.yaml`):
   - Matches namespaces with `workload-type: high-performance`
   - Routes to nodes with `node-type: batch`
   - Adds pod anti-affinity for better distribution

2. **Infrastructure Policy** (`infra.yaml`):
   - Matches namespaces with `workload-type: infrastructure`
   - Routes to nodes with `node-type: infrastructure`
   - Includes topology spread constraints for HA across zones
   - Adds pod anti-affinity for better distribution

3. **GPU Policy** (`gpu.yaml`):
   - Matches namespaces with `workload-type: gpu`
   - Routes to nodes with `node-type: gpu`
   - Adds appropriate GPU tolerations
   - Includes pod anti-affinity for distribution

4. **Spot Policy** (`spot.yaml`):
   - Default policy for namespaces without specific workload types
   - Routes to spot nodes
   - Adds both spot pool and Azure spot tolerations
   - Includes pod anti-affinity and node affinity for spot instances

To use these policies:

1. Apply all policies:
```bash
kubectl apply -f nap/batch.yaml
kubectl apply -f nap/infra.yaml
kubectl apply -f nap/gpu.yaml
kubectl apply -f nap/spot.yaml
```

2. Label your namespaces according to workload type:
```bash
# For high performance workloads
kubectl label namespace high-perf-ns workload-type=high-performance

# For infrastructure workloads
kubectl label namespace infra-ns workload-type=infrastructure

# For GPU workloads
kubectl label namespace gpu-ns workload-type=gpu

# No label needed for spot - it's the default
```

Key improvements in the separated policies:
- Each policy is more focused and easier to maintain
- Added pod anti-affinity to all policies for better distribution
- Added topology spread constraints for infrastructure workloads
- Enhanced spot policy with Azure-specific spot instance handling
- Each policy can be independently updated or disabled

Would you like me to:
1. Add any additional features to specific policies?
2. Add support for more workload types?
3. Modify any of the affinity or toleration settings?
