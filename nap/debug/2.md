Based on the debug logs you shared, I can see that the issue is specifically with installing the `aks-preview` extension for Azure CLI. The error occurs because pip can't connect to PyPI (Python Package Index) to download the required dependency `azure-mgmt-core>=1.5.0`.

The error is showing SSL connection issues:
```
WARNING: Retrying (Retry(total=0, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by 'SSLError(SSLEOFError(8, '[SSL: UNEXPECTED_EOF_WHILE_READING] EOF occurred in violation of protocol (_ssl.c:1006)'))': /simple/azure-mgmt-core/
```

This is most likely due to network connectivity issues, firewall restrictions, or SSL/TLS certificate problems. Here are some solutions to try:

1. **Check your network connection and proxy settings**:
   - If you're behind a corporate firewall, ensure it allows connections to PyPI (pypi.org)
   - Configure pip to use your proxy if needed:
     ```
     export HTTP_PROXY=http://your-proxy:port
     export HTTPS_PROXY=https://your-proxy:port
     ```

2. **Install the required dependency manually first**:
   ```
   pip install azure-mgmt-core>=1.5.0
   ```
   Then try installing the AKS preview extension again.

3. **Try with `--trusted-host` option** (if certificate validation is the issue):
   ```
   az extension add --name aks-preview --allow-preview true --trusted-host pypi.org
   ```

4. **Download packages locally and install offline** (if network access to PyPI is completely blocked):
   - On a machine with internet access, download the wheel files for:
     - aks-preview extension
     - azure-mgmt-core package
   - Transfer them to your target machine and install them manually

If you need to install CLI extensions in an offline/air-gapped environment, you might want to look into setting up a private PyPI mirror or using Azure CLI's extension management in offline mode.
