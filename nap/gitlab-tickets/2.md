# Implement GitOps for Node Management with Node Auto Provisioner

## Description

Following the implementation of our AKS cluster with Node Auto Provisioner and Flux GitOps, we need to establish a full GitOps workflow for managing node configurations. This will enable us to define, version, and deploy node classes and configurations through Git, ensuring our infrastructure remains in the desired state at all times.

## Objectives

- Implement GitOps workflow for managing node configurations
- Configure additional node pools through GitOps
- Set up Node Auto Provisioner configurations in Git
- Establish monitoring and alerts for node provisioning activities

## Technical Requirements

### Node Configuration Requirements
- Define at least 3 node classes:
  - General purpose (balanced CPU/memory)
  - Compute optimized (high CPU)
  - Memory optimized (high memory)
- Configure node taints and labels for workload targeting
- Set resource limits and quotas

### GitOps Implementation Requirements
- Node configurations stored in Git repository
- Automated synchronization via Flux
- Health checks for node pools
- Rollback mechanisms for failed configurations

## Implementation Steps

1. Create directory structure in the GitOps repository:
   ```
   /clusters/production/node-config/
   ├── kustomization.yaml
   ├── node-classes/
   │   ├── general-purpose.yaml
   │   ├── compute-optimized.yaml
   │   └── memory-optimized.yaml
   └── node-templates/
       ├── system-nodes.yaml
       ├── app-nodes.yaml
       └── batch-nodes.yaml
   ```

2. Implement the following Node Auto Provisioner configurations:
   - General purpose node class for regular workloads
   - Compute optimized nodes for CPU-intensive applications
   - Memory optimized nodes for data processing workloads

3. Set up Flux kustomization for node configurations:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2
   kind: Kustomization
   metadata:
     name: node-config
     namespace: flux-system
   spec:
     interval: 10m
     path: ./clusters/production/node-config
     prune: true
     sourceRef:
       kind: GitRepository
       name: flux-system
     timeout: 2m
   ```

4. Configure node auto-scaling policies based on:
   - CPU/memory utilization
   - Application-specific metrics
   - Time-based scaling for predictable workloads

5. Implement basic workloads to test node provisioning:
   - Deploy sample applications that target specific node classes
   - Test scaling scenarios to verify auto-provisioning

6. Set up monitoring and alerting:
   - Configure alerts for node provisioning failures
   - Create dashboards for node pool utilization

## Definition of Done
- Node configurations are managed through Git
- Node Auto Provisioner correctly creates node pools based on GitOps definitions
- Workloads correctly target appropriate node pools
- Monitoring and alerting are in place
- Documentation for the entire process is complete
- Knowledge transfer with application teams on how to request specific node types

## Dependencies
- Completion of "Implement AKS Cluster with Node Auto Provisioner and Flux GitOps" ticket
- Azure resource quotas for different VM types
