You're right - the `nodeProvisioningProfile` field is missing in the CAPZ configuration. Let me update the YAML to include this setting.

Let me also check if there are any other fields from your ASO configuration that might be missing in our CAPZ implementation.

I need to update the CAPZ YAML to include several additional fields from your ASO configuration that were missed in the initial implementation:

I've updated the YAML configuration to include all the missing fields from your ASO configuration. Let me summarize the key additions:

1. **Node Provisioning Profile**:
   ```yaml
   nodeProvisioningProfile:
     mode: Auto
   ```

2. **Network Configuration** additions:
   ```yaml
   ipFamilies:
   - IPv4
   loadBalancerSku: standard
   podCidr: ${POD_CIDR}
   serviceCidr: ${SERVICE_CIDR}
   dnsPrefix: ${CLUSTER_NAME}
   ```

3. **Linux Profile**:
   ```yaml
   linuxProfile:
     adminUsername: localadmin
     ssh:
       publicKeys:
       - keyData: ${SSH_PUBLIC_KEY}
   ```

4. **Monitoring Profiles**:
   ```yaml
   azureMonitorProfile:
     metrics:
       enabled: true
   
   metricsProfile:
     costAnalysis:
       enabled: true
   ```

5. **Workload AutoScaler Profile** (for KEDA):
   ```yaml
   workloadAutoScalerProfile:
     keda:
       enabled: true
   ```

6. **Support Plan**:
   ```yaml
   supportPlan: KubernetesOfficial
   ```

7. **Additional SKU details**:
   ```yaml
   sku:
     tier: Standard
     name: Base
   ```

### Notes on Field Mapping

When mapping from ASO to CAPZ, there are some important considerations:

1. Some fields might have different paths or slightly different names in CAPZ
2. Some ASO fields might not have direct equivalents in CAPZ
3. For fields not directly supported by CAPZ API, you can use the `asoManagedClusterPatches` field for customization

If any of these fields cause deployment issues, you may need to use the patching approach mentioned in the guide:

```yaml
spec:
  enablePreviewFeatures: true
  asoManagedClusterPatches:
  - '{"spec": {"fieldName": "value"}}'
```

This approach allows you to inject fields directly into the underlying ASO resource when CAPZ doesn't provide direct support for them.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the configuration, or would you like more information about how specific fields are mapped between ASO and CAPZ?
