# Change Management Guidelines: Dev vs Production Environments

## Overview
This document outlines our approach to change management across different environments, with specific focus on streamlining dev deployments while maintaining appropriate controls for production.

## Development Environment Philosophy

### Key Principles
- Fast feedback loops
- Rapid experimentation
- Developer autonomy
- Automated quality controls
- Minimal bureaucracy

### Automated Quality Gates
Development deployments should pass through automated gates rather than manual CAB approval:

```yaml
# Azure DevOps Pipeline Example
stages:
- stage: QualityGates
  jobs:
  - job: AutomatedChecks
    steps:
    - task: CodeAnalysis
      inputs:
        includeTests: true
        failOnIssues: true
    
    - task: SecurityScan
      inputs:
        severity: medium
        
    - task: ComplianceCheck
      inputs:
        policySet: 'dev-baseline'
```

### Development Controls
- Pull request reviews (2 approvers)
- Automated testing (unit, integration)
- Code quality metrics
- Security scanning
- Infrastructure validation
- Automated rollback capability

## Production Change Advisory Board (CAB)

### When CAB Review is Required
1. Production deployments affecting:
   - Customer-facing services
   - Critical business systems
   - Shared infrastructure
   - Multiple team dependencies
   
2. Major changes:
   - Architecture modifications
   - New third-party integrations
   - Database schema changes
   - Network topology updates

### CAB Process
1. Change Request Submission
   - Impact assessment
   - Rollback plan
   - Testing evidence
   - Resource requirements

2. Risk Assessment
   - Security implications
   - Performance impact
   - Compliance requirements
   - Business continuity

3. Implementation Planning
   - Deployment schedule
   - Communication plan
   - Success criteria
   - Monitoring strategy

## Environment-Specific Requirements

### Dev Environment
- Automated deployment via CI/CD
- Self-service capabilities
- Quick rollback mechanism
- Isolated resources
- Monitoring and logging

### Production Environment
- CAB approval required
- Change window scheduling
- Stakeholder sign-off
- Full audit trail
- Enhanced monitoring
- Staged rollout

## Best Practices

### Automation Over Process
- Implement policy-as-code
- Automated compliance checks
- Standardized deployment patterns
- Metrics-based approval gates

### Documentation Requirements
Dev:
- Basic README
- API documentation
- Dependencies list
- Local setup guide

Production:
- Full technical design
- Impact analysis
- Support runbook
- SLA documentation

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Dev Environment
- Deployment frequency
- Failed deployment rate
- Mean time to recovery
- Code quality trends

### Production
- Change success rate
- Incident correlation
- Recovery time
- Business impact metrics

## Emergency Process
Even in production, certain emergency changes may bypass full CAB:
1. Critical security patches
2. Production outage fixes
3. Data loss prevention
4. Compliance-mandated changes

These still require:
- Post-implementation review
- Incident documentation
- Root cause analysis
- Process improvement recommendations
