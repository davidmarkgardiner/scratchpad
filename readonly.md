Let me explain the readonly root filesystem in Kubernetes and how to work with it:

A readonly root filesystem is a security measure in Kubernetes where the container's root filesystem is mounted as read-only. This prevents attackers from modifying the container's filesystem at runtime, making it more secure. It's often enabled using:

```yaml
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

Working around this with /tmp:
1. Yes, you can use /tmp - Kubernetes allows you to create a writable `emptyDir` volume mount specifically for temporary files:

```yaml
spec:
  containers:
  - name: your-container
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp
      name: temp-volume
  volumes:
  - name: temp-volume
    emptyDir: {}
```

Some important considerations:
- The /tmp directory will be empty each time the pod starts
- Each pod gets its own isolated /tmp space
- Data in /tmp is lost when the pod terminates
- You can also specify a size limit using `emptyDir.sizeLimit`

Would you like me to show you a complete example with both readonly root filesystem and tmp volume configuration?
