Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) Core Platform Engineer position at xxx. With over 19 years of experience in technology and a specific focus on enterprise-scale container platforms, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to xxx's global platform engineering team.

My current role as a Senior DevSecOps Engineer has given me extensive hands-on experience with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) at an enterprise scale. I successfully led an initiative to consolidate over 1,500 Kubernetes clusters into a manageable fleet of under 20 clusters, implementing robust automation for provisioning, monitoring, and self-healing. This experience directly aligns with your team's focus on developing automation for large global fleet management of Kubernetes clusters.

I have developed numerous features for container platforms, including APIs, webhooks, and UIs, using Python and Go. My experience with Azure cloud native solutions, including Azure AD, PAAS services, and implementing secure CI/CD pipelines, matches your requirements for integrating container solutions within the enterprise ecosystem. I have also implemented comprehensive monitoring solutions using native Kubernetes tools and third-party products, ensuring production stability and performance.

What particularly excites me about this opportunity is the chance to work with a global team on large-scale cloud/container programs. My experience working across multiple financial institutions has given me valuable insights into the unique challenges and security requirements of the banking sector. I am well-versed in container security, vulnerability management, and implementing solutions that enable development teams to build, deploy, and monitor containerized applications effectively.

I am confident that my combination of technical expertise, leadership experience, and passion for container technologies makes me an ideal candidate for this role. I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can contribute to the success of xxx's CaaS Core Platform team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
David Gardiner
